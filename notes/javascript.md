## JavaScript Notes


#### Q. What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript?

1. **Object constructor:**

 The simpliest way to create an empty object is using Object constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.

 ```javascript
 var object = new Object();
 ```

 2. **Object's create method:**

 The create method of Object creates a new object by passing the prototype object as a parameter
 ```javascript
 var object = Object.create(null);
 ```

 3. **Object literal syntax:**
 The object literal syntax is equivalent to create method when it passes null as parameter
 ```javascript
 var object = {};
 ```

 4. **Function constructor:**
 Create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances,
 ```javascript
 function Person(name){
  var object = {};
  object.name = name;
  object.age = 26;
  return object;
 }
 var object = new Person("Pradeep");
 ```

 5. **Function constructor with prototype:**
 This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,

```javascript
function Person(){}
Person.prototype.name = "Pradeep";
var object = new Person();
```

This is equivalent to an instance created with an object create method with a function prototype and then call that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.
```javascript
function func {};

new func(x, y, z);

**(OR)**

// Create a new instance using function prototype.
var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)

// Call the function
var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),

// If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.
console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);
```

6. **ES6 Class syntax:**
ES6 introduces class feature to create the objects
```javascript
class Person {
 constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
 }
}

var object = new Person("Pradeep");
```

7. **Singleton pattern:**
A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.
```javascript
var object = new function(){
  this.name = "Pradeep";
}
```

#### Q. What is prototype chain?

**Prototype chaining** is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language. The prototype on object instance is available through Object.getPrototypeOf(object) or __proto__ property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through object.prototype.

#### Q. What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind?

**call():** The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one
```javascript
var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
    console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
}

invite.call(employee1, 'Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, 'Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```
**apply():** Invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array
```javascript
var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
    console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
}

invite.apply(employee1, ['Hello', 'How are you?']); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ['Hello', 'How are you?']); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```
**bind():** returns a new function, allowing you to pass in an array and any number of arguments
```javascript
var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
    console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
}

var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1('Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2('Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

#### Q. What is JSON and its common operations?

**JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by Douglas Crockford. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network and it is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json
Parsing: **Converting a string to a native object
```javascript
JSON.parse(text)
```
Stringification: **converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network
```javascript
JSON.stringify(object)
```

#### Q. What is the purpose of array slice method?

The **slice()** method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end. Some of the examples of this method are,
```javascript
let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0,2); // returns [1,2]
let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2,3); // returns [3]
let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]
```
**Note:** Slice method won't mutate the original array but it returns the subset as new array.

#### Q. What is the purpose of array splice method?

The **splice()** method is used either adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position for insertion or deletion whereas the option second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array. Some of the examples of this method are,
```javascript
let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0,2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]
let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]
let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, "a", "b", "c"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", 5]
```
**Note:** Splice method modifies the original array and returns the deleted array.

#### Q. What is the difference between slice and splice?

Some of the major difference in a tabular form

| Slice | Splice |
|---- | ---------
| Doesn't modify the original array(immutable)  | Modifies the original array(mutable) |
| Returns the subset of original array | Returns the deleted elements as array  |
| Used to pick the elements from array | Used to insert or delete elements to/from array|

#### Q. How do you compare Object and Map?
**Objects** are similar to **Maps** in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases.

1. The keys of an Object are Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive.
2. The keys in Map are ordered while keys added to object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in order of insertion.
3. You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.
4. A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.
5. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by using map = Object.create(null), but this is seldom done.
6. A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs.

#### Q. What is the difference between == and === operators?
JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators takes type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,
1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value.
   There are two special cases in this,
   1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
   2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e,
    null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true

Some of the example which covers the above cases
```javascript
0 == false   // true
0 === false  // false
1 == "1"     // true
1 === "1"    // false
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
'0' == false // true
'0' === false // false
[]==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
{}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
```

#### Q. What are lambda or arrow functions?
An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression and does not have its own **this, arguments, super, or new.target**. These function are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

#### Q. What is a first class function?
In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. For example, in the below example, handler functions assigned to a listener
```javascript
const handler = () => console.log ('This is a click handler function');
document.addEventListener ('click', handler);
```
#### Q. What is a first order function?
First-order function is a function that doesn’t accept other function as an argument and doesn’t return a function as its return value.
```javascript
const firstOrder = () => console.log ('Iam a first order functionn!');
```
#### Q. What is a higher order function?
Higher-order function is a function that accepts other function as an argument or returns a function as a return value.
```javascript
const firstOrderFunc = () => console.log ('Hello I'am a First order function');
const higherOrder = ReturnFirstOrderFunc => ReturnFirstOrderFunc ();
higherOrder (firstOrderFunc);
```
#### Q. What is a unary function?
Unary function (i.e. monadic) is a function that accepts exactly one argument. Let us take an example of unary function. It stands for single argument accepted by a function.
```javascript
const unaryFunction = a => console.log (a + 10); //Add 10 to the given argument and display the value
```
#### Q. What is currying function?
Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. Currying is named after a mathematician Haskell Curry. By applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function. Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function
```javascript
function volume1(length) {
  return function(width) {
    return function(height) {
      return height * width * length;
    }
  }
}

volume1(2)(3)(4); // 24
```
Curried functions are great to improve code re-usability and functional composition.

#### Q. What is a pure function?

A **Pure function** is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value. Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,
```javascript
//Impure
let numberArray = [];
const impureAddNumber = number => numberArray.push (number);
//Pure
const pureAddNumber = number => argNumberArray =>
  argNumberArray.concat ([number]);

//Display the results
console.log (impureAddNumber (6)); // returns 6
console.log (numberArray); // returns [6]
console.log (pureAddNumber (7) (numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]
console.log (numberArray); // returns [6]
```
As per above code snippets, Push function is impure itself by altering the array and returning an push number index which is independent of parameter value. Whereas Concat on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of previous array.
Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and makes harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with **Immutability** concept of ES6 by giving preference to **const** over **let** usage.

#### Q. What is the purpose of let keyword?

The let statement declares a **block scope local variable**. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the var keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,
```javascript
let counter = 30;
if (counter === 30) {
  let counter = 31;
  console.log(counter); // 31
}
console.log(counter); // 30 (because if block variable won't exist here)
```

#### Q. What is the difference between let and var?
You can list out the differences in a tabular format

| var | let |
|---- | ---------
| It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript  | Introduced as part of ES6 |
| It has function scope | It has block scope  |
| Variables will be hoisted | Won't get hoisted|

Let's take an example to see the difference,
```javascript
function userDetails(username) {
   if(username) {
     console.log(salary); // undefined(due to hoisting)
     console.log(age); // error: age is not defined
     let age = 30;
     var salary = 10000;
   }
   console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible to due function scope)
   console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
}
```
#### Q. What is the reason to choose the name let as keyword?
Let is a mathematical statement that was adopted by early programming languages like Scheme and Basic. It has been borrowed from dozens of other languages that use let already as a traditional keyword as close to var as possible.

#### Q.How do you redeclare variables in switch block without an error?
If you try to redeclare variables in a `switch block` then it will cause errors because there is only one block. For example, the below code block throws a syntax error as below,
```javascript
let counter = 1;
switch(x) {
    case 0:
    let name;
    break;

    case 1:
    let name; // SyntaxError for redeclaration.
    break;
}
```
To avoid this error, you can create a nested block inside a case clause will create a new block scoped lexical environment.
```javascript
let counter = 1;
    switch(x) {
        case 0: {
        let name;
        break;
        }
        case 1: {
        let name; // No SyntaxError for redeclaration.
        break;
        }
    }
```
#### Q. What is Temporal Dead Zone?
The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variable’s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone. Let's see this behavior with an example,
```javascript
function somemethod() {
    console.log(counter1); // undefined
    console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
    var counter1 = 1;
    let counter2 = 2;
}
```
#### Q. What is IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,
```javascript
(function ()
    {
        // logic here
    }
    )
();
```
The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables with IIFE then it throws an error as below,
```javascript
(function ()
        {
            var message = "IIFE";
            console.log(message);
        }
    )
();
console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined
```
#### Q. What is the benefit of using modules?
There are a lot of benefits to using modules in favour of a sprawling. Some of the benefits are,
1. Maintainablity
2. Reusability
3. Namespacing

#### Q. What is memoization?
Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results.  Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.
Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,
```javascript
const memoizAddition = () => {
    let cache = {};
    return (value) => {
    if (value in cache) {
    console.log('Fetching from cache');
    return cache.value;
    }
    else {
    console.log('Calculating result');
    let result = value + 20;
    cache[value] = result;
    return result;
    }
    }
}
// returned function from memoizAddition
const addition = memoizAddition();
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached
```

#### Q. What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.
Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,
```javascript
console.log(message); //output : undefined
var message = ’The variable Has been hoisted’;
```
The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,
```javascript
var message;
console.log(message);
message = ’The variable Has been hoisted’;
```

#### Q. What are classes in ES6?
In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.
For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,
```javascript
function Bike(model,color) {
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
}

Bike.prototype.getDetails = function() {
    return this.model+ ' bike has' + this.color+ ' color';
};
```
Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative
```javascript
class Bike{
  constructor(color, model) {
    this.color= color;
    this.model= model;
  }
}
```

#### Q. What are closures?
A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables. The closure has three scope chains
1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
2. Outer function’s variables
3. Global variables
Let's take an example of closure concept,
```javascript
function Welcome(name){
  var greetingInfo = function(message){
    console.log(message+' '+name);
  }
return greetingInfo;
}
var myFunction = Welcome('John');
myFunction('Welcome '); //Output: Welcome John
myFunction('Hello Mr.'); //output: Hello Mr.John
```
As per the above code, the inner function(greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(Welcome) even after outer function has returned.

#### Q. What are modules?
Modules refers small units of independent, reusable code and also act as foundation of many JavaScript design patterns.  Most of the JavaScript modules export an object literal, a function, or a constructor

#### Q. Why do you need modules?
Below are the list of benefits using modules in javascript ecosystem
1. Maintainablity
2. Reusability
3. Namespacing
#### Q. What is scope in javascript?
Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.
#### Q. What is a service worker?
A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in background, separate from a web page and provide features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Some of the major features of service workers are Rich offline experiences(offline first web application development), periodic background syncs, push notifications, intercept and handle network requests and programmatically managing a cache of responses.

#### Q. How do you manipulate DOM using service worker?
Service worker can't access the DOM directly. But it can communicate with the pages it controls by responding to messages sent via the `postMessage` interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM.

#### Q. How do you reuse information across service worker restarts?
The problem with service worker is that it get terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's `onfetch` and `onmessage` handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.

#### Q. What is IndexedDB?
IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of larger amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches of this data.

#### Q. What is web storage?
Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.
1. **Local storage:** It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
2. **Session storage:** It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

#### Q. What is a post message?
Post message is a method that enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.(i.e, between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it). Generally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port number, and host).

#### Q. What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs.
For example, you can create a cookie named username as below,
```javascript
document.cookie = "username=John";
```
#### Q. Why do you need a Cookie?
Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,
1. When a user visits a web page, user profile can be stored in a cookie.
2. Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers user profile.

#### Q. What are the options in a cookie?
There are few below options available for a cookie,
1. By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed but you can change this behavior by setting expiry date (in UTC time).
```javascript
document.cookie = "username=John expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC";
```
2. By default, the cookie belongs to a current page. But you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to using a path parameter.
```javascript
document.cookie = "username=John path=/services";
```

#### Q. How do you delete a cookie?
You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date as a passed date. You don't need to specify a cookie value in this case.
For example, you can delete a username cookie in the current page as below.
```javascript
document.cookie = "username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
```
**Note:** You should define the cookie path option to ensure that you delete the right cookie. Some browsers doesn't allow to delete a cookie unless you specify a path parameter.

#### Q. What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage?
Below are some of the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage,

| Feature | Cookie | Local storage | Session storage |
|---- | --------- | ----- | ----- |
| Accessed on client or server side | Both server-side & client-side | client-side only | client-side only |
| Lifetime | As configured using Expires option  | until deleted | until tab is closed |
| SSL support | Supported | Not supported | Not supported |
| Maximum data size | 4KB | 5 MB | 5MB |

#### Q. What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?
LocalStorage is same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.

#### Q. How do you access web storage?
The Window object implements the `WindowLocalStorage` and `WindowSessionStorage` objects which has `localStorage`(window.localStorage) and `sessionStorage`(window.sessionStorage) properties respectively. These properties create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed for a specific domain and storage type (session or local).
For example, you can read and write on local storage objects as below
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('logo', document.getElementById('logo').value);
localStorage.getItem('logo');
```
#### Q. What are the methods available on session storage?
The session storage provided methods for reading, writing and clearing the session data
```javascript
// Save data to sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value');

// Get saved data from sessionStorage
let data = sessionStorage.getItem('key');

// Remove saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.removeItem('key');

// Remove all saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.clear();
```
#### Q. What is a storage event and its event handler?
The StorageEvent is an event that fires when a storage area has been changed in the context of another document. Whereas onstorage property is an EventHandler for processing storage events.
The syntax would be as below
```javascript
  window.onstorage = functionRef;
```
Let's take the example usage of onstorage event handler which logs the storage key and it's values
```javascript
window.onstorage = function(e) {
  console.log('The ' + e.key +
    ' key has been changed from ' + e.oldValue +
    ' to ' + e.newValue + '.');
};
```
#### Q. Why do you need web storage?
Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Also, the information is never transferred to the server. Hence this is recommended approach than Cookies.

#### Q. How do you check web storage browser support?
You need to check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage before using web storage,
```javascript
if (typeof(Storage) !== "undefined") {
  // Code for localStorage/sessionStorage.
} else {
  // Sorry! No Web Storage support..
}
```
#### Q. How do you check web workers browser support?
You need to check browser support for web workers before using it
```javascript
if (typeof(Worker) !== "undefined") {
  // code for Web worker support.
} else {
  // Sorry! No Web Worker support..
}
```
#### Q. Give an example of web worker?
You need to follow below steps to start using web workers for counting example
1. Create a Web Worker File:  You need to write a script to increment the count value. Let's name it as counter.js
```javascript
let i = 0;

function timedCount() {
  i = i + 1;
  postMessage(i);
  setTimeout("timedCount()",500);
}

timedCount();
```
Here postMessage() method is used to post a message back to the HTML page
2. Create a Web Worker Object: You can create a web worker object by checking for browser support. Let's name this file as web_worker_example.js
```javascript
if (typeof(w) == "undefined") {
  w = new Worker("counter.js");
}
```
and we can receive messages from web worker
```javascript
w.onmessage = function(event){
  document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = event.data;
};
```
3. Terminate a Web Worker:
Web workers will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated. You can use terminate() method to terminate listening the messages.
```javascript
w.terminate();
```
4. Reuse the Web Worker: If you set the worker variable to undefined you can reuse the code
```javascript
w = undefined;
```
#### Q. What are the restrictions of web workers on DOM?
WebWorkers don't have access to below javascript objects since they are defined in an external files
1. Window object
2. Document object
3. Parent object

#### Q. What is a promise?
    A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved(for example, network error). It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.
    The syntax of promise would be as below
    ```javascript
    const promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      // promise description
    })
    ```
#### Q. Why do you need a promise?
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative approach for callbacks by reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code.

#### Q. What are the three states of promise?
Promises have three states:
1. **Pending:** This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
2. **Fulfilled:** This state indicates that specified operation was completed.
3. **Rejected:** This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.

#### Q. What is a callback function?
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.
Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function
```javascript
function callbackFunction(name) {
  console.log('Hello ' + name);
}

function outerFunction(callback) {
  let name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}

outerFunction(callbackFunction);
```
#### Q. Why do we need callbacks?
The callbacks are needed because javascript is a event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.
Let's take an example with first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and next function which logs the message.
```javascript
function firstFunction(){
  // Simulate a code delay
  setTimeout( function(){
    console.log('First function called');
  }, 1000 );
}
function secondFunction(){
  console.log('Second function called');
}
firstFunction();
secondFunction();

Output
// Second function called
// First function called
```
As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of first function and remaining code block get executed. So callbacks used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until other code finished execution.

#### Q. What is a callback hell?
Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,
```javascript
async1(function(){
    async2(function(){
        async3(function(){
            async4(function(){
                ....
            });
        });
    });
});
```
#### Q. What is server-sent events?
Server-sent events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a browser to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection without resorting to polling. These are a one way communications channel - events flow from server to client only. This is been used in Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds etc.

#### Q. How do you receive server-sent event notifications?
The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications. For example, you can receive messages from server as below,
```javascript
if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
  var source = new EventSource("sse_generator.js");
  source.onmessage = function(event) {
    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
  };
}
```
#### Q. How do you check browser support for server-sent events?
You can perform browser support for server-sent events before using it as below,
```javascript
if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
  // Server-sent events supported. Let's have some code here!
} else {
  // No server-sent events supported
}
```
#### Q. What are the events available for server sent events?
Below are the list of events available for server sent events
| Event | Description |
|---- | ---------
| onopen  | It is used when a connection to the server is opened |
| onmessage | This event is used when a message is received  |
| onerror | It happens when an error occurs|

#### Q. What are the main rules of promise?
A promise must follow a specific set of rules,
1. A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant `.then()` method
2. A pending promise may transition into either fulfilled or rejected state
3. A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled and it must not transition into any other state.
4. Once a promise is settled, the value must not change.

#### Q. What is callback in callback?
You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks.
```javascript
loadScript('/script1.js', function(script) {
    console.log('first script is loaded');

  loadScript('/script2.js', function(script) {

    console.log('second script is loaded');

    loadScript('/script3.js', function(script) {

        console.log('third script is loaded');
      // after all scripts are loaded
    });

  })

});
```
#### Q. What is promise chaining?
The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result,
```javascript
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log(result); // 1
  return result * 2;

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log(result); // 2
  return result * 3;

}).then(function(result) {

  console.log(result); // 6
  return result * 4;

});
```
In the above handlers, the result is passed to the chain of .then() handlers with the below work flow,
1. The initial promise resolves in 1 second,
2. After that `.then` handler is called by logging the result(1) and then return a promise with the value of result * 2.
3. After that the value passed to the next `.then` handler by logging the result(2) and return a promise with result * 3.
4. Finally the value passed to the last `.then` handler by logging the result(6) and return a promise with result * 4.

#### Q. What is promise.all?
Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable), and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected. For example, the syntax of promise.all method is below,
```javascript
Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => {   console.log(result) }) .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`))
```
**Note:** Remember that the order of the promises(output the result) is maintained as per input order.

#### Q. What is the purpose of race method in promise?
Promise.race() method will return the promise instance which is firstly resolved or rejected. Let's take an example of race() method where promise2 is resolved first
```javascript
var promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'one');
});
var promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'two');
});

Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(value) {
  console.log(value); // "two" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster
});
```
#### Q. What is a strict mode in javascript?
Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `“use strict”;` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode.

#### Q. Why do you need strict mode?
Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.

#### Q. How do you declare strict mode?
The strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.
If declare at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.
```javascript
"use strict";
x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared
```
and if you declare inside a function, it has local scope
```javascript
x = 3.14;       // This will not cause an error.
myFunction();

function myFunction() {
  "use strict";
  y = 3.14;   // This will cause an error
}
```
#### Q. What is the purpose of double exclamation?
The double exclamation or negation(!!) ensures the resulting type is a boolean. If it was falsey (e.g. 0, null, undefined, etc.), it will be false, otherwise, true.
For example, you can test IE version using this expression as below,
```javascript
let isIE8 = false;
isIE8 = !! navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/);
console.log(isIE8); // returns true or false
```
If you don't use this expression then it returns the original value.
```javascript
console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/));  // returns either an Array or null
```
**Note:** The expression !! is not an operator, but it is just twice of ! operator.

#### Q. What is the purpose of delete operator?
The delete keyword is used to delete the property as well as its value.
```javascript
var user= {name: "John", age:20};
delete user.age;

console.log(user); // {name: "John"}
```
#### Q. What is typeof operator?
You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. It returns the type of a variable or an expression.
```javascript
typeof "John Abraham"     // Returns "string"
typeof (1 + 2)        // Returns "number"
```
#### Q. What is undefined property?
The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.
```javascript
var user;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined
console.log(typeof(user)) //undefined
```
Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to undefined.
```javascript
user = undefined
```
#### Q. What is null value?
The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values. The type of null value is object.
You can empty the variable by setting the value to null.
```javascript
var user = null;
console.log(typeof(user)) //object
```
#### Q. What is the difference between null and undefined?
Below are the main differences between null and undefined,

| Null | Undefined |
|---- | -----------|
| It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object.  | It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. |
| Type of null is object | Type of undefined is undefined  |
| The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. | The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.|
| Indicates the absence of a value for a variable | Indicates absence of variable itself |
| Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations | Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations |

#### Q. What is eval?
The eval() function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string. The string can be a JavaScript expression, variable, statement, or sequence of statements.
```javascript
console.log(eval('1 + 2')); //  3
```
#### Q. What is the difference between window and document?
Below are the main differences between window and document,

| Window | Document |
|---- | ---------
| It is the root level element in any web page  | It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM) |
| By default window object is available implicitly in the page | You can access it via window.document or document.  |
| It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location | It provides methods like getElementById, getElementByTagName, createElement etc  |

#### Q. How do you access history in javascript?
The window.history object contains the browsers history. You can load previous and next URLs in the history using back() and next() methods.
```javascript
function goBack() {
  window.history.back()
}
function goForward() {
  window.history.forward()
}
```
**Note:** You can also access history without window prefix.

#### Q. What are the javascript data types?
Below are the list of javascript data types available
1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Object
5. Undefined

#### Q. What is isNaN?
The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number) or not. i.e, This function returns true if the value equates to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.
```javascript
isNaN('Hello') //true
isNaN('100') //false
```
#### Q. What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables?
Below are the major differences between undeclared and undefined variables,

| undeclared | undefined |
|---- | ---------
| These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared  | These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value |
| If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered | If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.  |

#### Q. What are global variables?
Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code without any scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable but if you omit it then it will become global variable
```javascript
msg = "Hello" // var is missing, it becomes global variable
```
#### Q. What are the problems with global variables?
The problem with global variables is the conflict of variable names of local and global scope. It is also difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.

#### Q. What is NaN property?
The NaN property is a global property that represents "Not-a-Number" value. i.e, It indicates that a value is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in a program but it can be used as return value for few cases
```javascript
Math.sqrt(-1)
parseInt("Hello")
```
#### Q. What is the purpose of isFinite function?
The isFinite() function is used to determine whether a number is a finite, legal number. It returns false if the value is +infinity, -infinity, or NaN (Not-a-Number), otherwise it returns true.
```javascript
isFinite(Infinity);  // false
isFinite(NaN);       // false
isFinite(-Infinity); // false

isFinite(100);         // true
```
#### Q. What is an event flow?
Event flow is the order in which event is received on the web page. When you click an element that is nested in various other elements, before your click actually reaches its destination, or target element, it must trigger the click event each of its parent elements first, starting at the top with the global window object.
There are two ways of event flow
1. Top to Bottom(Event Capturing)
2. Bottom to Top (Event Bubbling)

#### Q. What is event bubbling?
Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event first triggers on the innermost target element, and then successively triggers on the ancestors (parents) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM element.

#### Q. What is event capturing?
Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event is first captured by the outermost element and , and then successively triggers on the descendants (children) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the inner DOM element.

#### Q. How do you submit a form using JavaScript?
You can submit a form using JavaScript use document.form[0].submit(). All the form input's information is submitted using onsubmit event handler
```javascript
function submit() {
    document.form[0].submit();
}
```
#### Q. How do you find operating system details?
The window.navigator object contains information about the visitor's browser os details. Some of the OS properties are avaialble under platform property,
```javascript
console.log(navigator.platform);
```
#### Q. What is the difference between document load and DOMContentLoaded events?
The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for assets(stylesheets, images, and subframes) to finish loading. Whereas The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources(stylesheets, images).

#### Q. What is the difference between native, host and user objects?
`Native objects` are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification. For example, String, Math, RegExp, Object, Function etc core objects defined in the ECMAScript spec.
`Host objects` are objects provided by the browser or runtime environment (Node). For example, window, XmlHttpRequest, DOM nodes etc considered as host objects.
`User objects` are objects defined in the javascript code. For example, User object created for profile information.

#### Q. What are the tools or techniques used for debugging JavaScript code?
You can use below tools or techniques for debugging javascript
1. Chrome Devtools
2. debugger statement
3. Good old console.log statement

#### Q. What are the pros and cons of promises over callbacks?
Below are the list of pros and cons of promises over callbacks,
**Pros:**
1. It avoids callback hell which is unreadable
2. Easy to write sequential asynchronous code with .then()
3. Easy to write parallel asynchronous code with Promise.all()
4. Solves some of the common problems of callbacks(call the callback too late, too early, many times and swallow errors/exceptions)

**Cons:**
1. It makes little complex code
2. You need to load a polyfill if ES6 is not supported

#### Q. What is the difference between an attribute and a property?
Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element has 2 attributes type and value,
```javascript
<input type="text" value="Name:">
```
You can retrieve the attribute value as below,
```javascript
const input = document.querySelector('input');
console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Good morning
console.log(input.value); // Good morning
```
And after you change the value of the text field to "Good evening", it becomes like
```javascript
console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Good morning
console.log(input.value); // Good evening
```
#### Q. What is same-origin policy?
The same-origin policy is a policy that prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. If you enable this policy then it prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page using Document Object Model(DOM).

#### Q. What is the purpose of void 0?
Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing. This will be helpful to eliminate the unwanted side-effect, because it will return the undefined primitive value. It is commonly used for HTML document that uses href="JavaScript:Void(0);" within an <a> element. i.e, when you click a link, the browser loads a new page or refreshes the same page. But this behavior will be prevented using this expression.
For example, the below link notify the message without reloading the page
```javascript
<a href="JavaScript:void(0);" onclick="alert('Well done!')">Click Me!</a>
```
#### Q. Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language?
JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays  modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

#### Q. Is JavaScript a case-sensitive language?
Yes, JavaScript is a case sensitive language. The language keywords, variables, function & object names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

#### Q. Is there any relation between Java and JavaScript?
No, they are entirely two different programming languages and has nothing to do with each other. But both of them are Object Oriented Programming languages and like many other languages, they follow similar syntax for basic features(if, else, for, switch, break, continue etc).

#### Q. What are events?
Events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can `react` on these events. Some of the examples of HTML events are,

1. Web page has finished loading
2. Input field was changed
3. Button was clicked

Let's describe the behavior of click event for button element,

```javascript
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <script>
    function greeting() {
      alert('Hello! Good morning');
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <button type="button" onclick="greeting()">Click me</button>
</body>
</html>
```
#### Q. Who created javascript?
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. Initially it was developed under the name `Mocha`, but later the language was officially called `LiveScript` when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape.

#### Q. What is the use of preventDefault method?
The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action or behaviour that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, prevent form submission when clicking on submit button and prevent opening the page URL when clicking on hyper link are some common usecases.
```javascript
document.getElementById("link").addEventListener("click", function(event){
event.preventDefault();
});
```
**Note:** Remember that not all events are cancelable.

#### Q. What is the use of stopPropagation method?
The stopPropagation method is used to stop the event from bubbling up the event chain. For example, the below nested divs with stopPropagation method prevents default event propagation when clicking on nested div(Div1)
```javascript
<p>Click DIV1 Element</p>
<div onclick="secondFunc()">DIV 2
  <div onclick="firstFunc(event)">DIV 1</div>
</div>

<script>
function firstFunc(event) {
  alert("DIV 1");
  event.stopPropagation();
}

function secondFunc() {
  alert("DIV 2");
}
</script>
```
#### Q. What are the steps involved in return false usage?
The return false statement in event handlers performs the below steps,
1. First it stops the browser's default action or behaviour.
2. It prevents the event from propagating the DOM
3. Stops callback execution and returns immediately when called.

#### Q. What is BOM?
The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser. It consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document which are children of window. The Browser Object Model is not standardized and can change based on different browsers.

#### Q. What is the use of setTimeout?
The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,
```javascript
setTimeout(function(){ console.log("Good morning"); }, 2000);
```
#### Q. What is the use of setInterval?
The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,
```javascript
setInterval(function(){ console.log("Good morning"); }, 2000);
```
#### Q. Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded?
JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

#### Q. What is an event delegation?
Event delegation is a technique for listening to events where you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the events that happen inside it.
For example, if you wanted to detect field changes in inside a specific form, you can use event delegation technique,
```javascript
var form = document.querySelector('#registration-form');

// Listen for changes to fields inside the form
form.addEventListener('input', function (event) {

// Log the field that was changed
console.log(event.target);

}, false);
```
#### Q. What is ECMAScript?
ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript. ECMAScript standardized by the ECMA International standards organization in the ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 specifications. The first edition of ECMAScript was released in 1997.

#### Q. What is JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language in the way objects are built in JavaScript.

#### Q. What are the syntax rules of JSON?
Below are the list of syntax rules of JSON
1. The data is in name/value pairs
2. The data is separated by commas
3. Curly braces hold objects
4. Square brackets hold arrays

#### Q. What is the purpose JSON stringify?
When sending data to a web server, the data has to be in a string format. You can achieve this by converting JSON object into a string using stringify() method.
```javascript
var userJSON = {'name': 'John', age: 31}
var userString = JSON.stringify(user);
console.log(userString); //"{"name":"John","age":31}"
```
#### Q. How do you parse JSON string?
When receiving the data from a web server, the data is always in a string format. But you can convert this string value to javascript object using parse() method.
```javascript
var userString = '{"name":"John","age":31}';
var userJSON = JSON.parse(userString);
console.log(userJSON);// {name: "John", age: 31}
```
#### Q. Why do you need JSON?
When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text. Since JSON is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

#### Q. What are PWAs?
Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a type of mobile app delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These PWAs are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.

#### Q. What is the purpose of clearTimeout method?
The clearTimeout() function is used in javascript to clear the timeout which has been set by setTimeout()function before that. i.e, The return value of setTimeout() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearTimeout() function to clear the timer.
For example, the below setTimeout method is used to display the message after 3 seconds. This timeout can be cleared by clearTimeout() method.
```javascript
<script>
var msg;
function greeting() {
  alert('Good morning');
}
function start() {
  msg =setTimeout(greeting, 3000);

}

function stop() {
    clearTimeout(msg);
}
</script>
```
#### Q. What is the purpose of clearInterval method?
The clearInterval() function is used in javascript to clear the interval which has been set by setInterval() function. i.e, The return value returned by setInterval() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearInterval() function to clear the interval.
For example, the below setInterval method is used to display the message for every 3 seconds. This interval can be cleared by clearInterval() method.
```javascript
<script>
var msg;
function greeting() {
  alert('Good morning');
}
function start() {
  msg = setInterval(greeting, 3000);

}

function stop() {
    clearInterval(msg);
}
</script>
```
#### Q. How do you redirect new page in javascript?
In vanilla javascript, you can redirect to a new page using `location` property of window object. The syntax would be as follows,
```javascript
function redirect() {
  window.location.href = 'newPage.html';
}
```
#### Q. How do you check whether a string contains a substring?
There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,
1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided `String.prototype.includes` method to test a string contains a substring
```javascript
var mainString = "hello", subString = "hell";
mainString.includes(subString)
```
2. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environments, you can use `String.prototype.indexOf` which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exist in the main string.
```javascript
var mainString = "hello", subString = "hell";
mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1
```
3. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions
```javascript
var mainString = "hello", regex = "/hell/";
regex.test(mainString)
```
#### Q. How do you validate an email in javascript?
You can validate an email in javascript using regular expressions. It is recommended to do validations on the server side instead client side. Because the javascript can be disabled on the client side.
```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
    var re = /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
    return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());
}
```
The above regular expression regular accepts unicode characters.

#### Q. How do you get the current url with javascript?
You can use `window.location.href` expression to get the current url path and you can use the same expression for updating the URL too. You can also use `document.URL` for read-only purpose but this solution has issues in FF.
```javascript
console.log('location.href', window.location.href); // Returns full URL
```
#### Q. What are the various url properties of location object?
The below `Location` object properties can be used to access URL components of the page,
1. href - The entire URL
2. protocol - The protocol of the URL
3. host - The hostname and port of the URL
4. hostname - The hostname of the URL
5. port - The port number in the URL
6. pathname - The path name of the URL
7. search - The query portion of the URL
8. hash - The anchor portion of the URL

#### Q. How do get query string values in javascript?
You can use URLSearchParams to get query string values in javascript. Let's see an example to get the client code value from URL query string,
```javascript
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const clientCode = urlParams.get('clientCode');
```
#### Q. How do you check if a key exists in an object?
You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using two approaches,
1. ** Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not
```javascript
"key" in obj
```
and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,
```javascript
!("key" in obj)
```
2. ** Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use `hasOwnProperty` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)
```javascript
obj.hasOwnProperty("key") // true
```
#### Q. How do you loop through or enumerate javascript object?
You can use the `for-in` loop to loop through javascript object. You can also make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype using `hasOwnProperty` method.
```javascript
var object = {
    "k1": "value1",
    "k2": "value2",
    "k3": "value3"
};

for (var key in object) {
    if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        console.log(key + " -> " + object[key]); // k1 -> value1 ...
    }
}
```
#### Q. How do you test for an empty object?
There are different solutions based on ECMAScript versions
1. **Using Object entries(ECMA 7+):** You can use object entries length along with constructor type.
```javascript
Object.entries(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
```
2. **Using Object keys(ECMA 5+):** You can use object keys length along with constructor type.
```javascript
Object.keys(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
```
3. **Using for-in with hasOwnProperty(Pre-ECMA 5):** You can use for-in loop along with hasOwnProperty.
```javascript
function isEmpty(obj) {
  for(var prop in obj) {
    if(obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return JSON.stringify(obj) === JSON.stringify({});
}
```
#### Q. What is an arguments object?
The arguments object is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. For example, let's see how to use arguments object inside sum function,
```javascript
function sum() {
    var total = 0;
    for (var i = 0, len = arguments.length; i < len; ++i) {
        total += arguments[i];
    }
    return total;
}

sum(1, 2, 3) // returns 6
```
#### Q. How do you make first letter of the string in an uppercase?
You can create a function which uses chain of string methods such as charAt, toUpperCase and slice methods to generate a string with first letter in uppercase.
```javascript
function capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {
    return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
}
```
#### Q. What are the pros and cons of for loop?
The for-loop is a commonly used iteration syntax in javascript. It has both pros and cons
**Pros**
1. Works on every environment
2. You can use break and continue flow control statements
**Cons**
1. Too verbose
2. Imperative
3. You might face one-by-off errors

#### Q. How do you display the current date in javascript?
You can use `new Date()` to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time. For example, let's display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy
```javascript
var today = new Date();
var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); //January is 0!
var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

today = mm + '/' + dd + '/' + yyyy;
document.write(today);
```
#### Q. How do you compare two date objects?
You need to use use date.getTime() method to compare date values instead comparision operators (==, !=, ===, and !== operators)
```javascript
var d1 = new Date();
var d2 = new Date(d1);
console.log(d1.getTime() === d2.getTime()); //True
console.log(d1 === d2); // False
```
#### Q. How do you check if a string starts with another string?
You can use ECMAScript 6's `String.prototype.startsWith()` method to check a string starts with another string or not. But it is not yet supported in all browsers. Let's see an example to see this usage,
```javascript
"Good morning".startsWith("Good"); // true
"Good morning".startsWith("morning"); // false
```
#### Q. How do you trim a string in javascript?
JavaScript provided a trim method on string types to trim any whitespaces present at the begining or ending of the string.
```javascript
"  Hello World   ".trim(); //Hello World
```
If your browser(<IE9) doesn't support this method then you can use below polyfill.
```javascript
if (!String.prototype.trim) {
    (function() {
        // Make sure we trim BOM and NBSP
        var rtrim = /^[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+|[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+$/g;
        String.prototype.trim = function() {
            return this.replace(rtrim, '');
        };
    })();
}
```
#### Q. How do you add a key value pair in javascript?
There are two possible solutions to add new properties to an object. Let's take a simple object to explain these solutions.
```javascript
var object = {
    key1: value1,
    key2: value2
};
```
1. **Using dot notation:** This solution is useful when you know the name of the property
```javascript
object.key3 = "value3";
```
2. **Using square bracket notation:** This solution is useful when the name of the property is dynamically determined.
```javascript
obj["key3"] = "value3";
```
#### Q. Is the !-- notation represents a special operator?
No,that's not a special operator. But it is a combination of 2 standard operators one after the other,
1. A logical not (!)
2. A prefix decrement (--)

At first, the value decremented by one and then tested to see if it is equal to zero or not for determining the truthy/falsy value.

#### Q. How do you assign default values to variables?
You can use the logical or operator `||` in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,
```javascript
var a = b || c;
```
As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.

#### Q. How do you define multiline strings?
You can define multiline string literals using '\' character followed by line terminator.
```javascript
var str = "This is a \
very lengthy \
sentence!";
```
But if you have a space after the '\' character, the code will look exactly the same, but it will raise a SyntaxError.

#### Q. What is an app shell model?
An application shell (or app shell) architecture is one way to build a Progressive Web App that reliably and instantly loads on your users' screens, similar to what you see in native applications. It is useful for getting some initial HTML to the screen fast without a network.

#### Q. Can we define properties for functions?
Yes, We can define properties for functions because functions are also objects.
```javascript
fn = function(x) {
  //Function code goes here
}

fn.name = "John";

fn.profile = function(y) {
  //Profile code goes here
}
```
#### Q. What is the way to find the number of parameters expected by a function?
You can use `function.length` syntax to find the number of parameters expected by a function. Let's take an example of `sum` function to calculate the sum of numbers,
```javascript
function sum(num1, num2, num3, num4){
    return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
}
sum.length // 4 is the number of parameters expected.
```
#### Q. What is a polyfill?
A polyfill is a piece of JS code used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. For example, Silverlight plugin polyfill can be used to mimic the functionality of an HTML Canvas element on Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.

#### Q. What are break and continue statements?
The break statement is used to "jumps out" of a loop. i.e, It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.
```javascript
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) { break; }
  text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
}
```
The continue statement is used to "jumps over" one iteration in the loop. i.e, It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.
```javascript
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) { continue; }
    text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
}
```
#### Q. What are js labels?
The label statement allows us to name loops and blocks in JavaScript. We can then use these labels to refer back to the code later. For example, the below code with labels avoids printing the numbers when they are same,
```javascript
var i, j;

loop1:
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  loop2:
  for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      if (i === j) {
        continue loop1;
      }
      console.log('i = ' + i + ', j = ' + j);
  }
}

// Output is:
//   "i = 1, j = 0"
//   "i = 2, j = 0"
//   "i = 2, j = 1"
```
#### Q. What are the benefits of keeping declarations at the top?
It is recommended to keep all declarations at the top of each script or function. The benefits of doing this are,
1. Gives cleaner code
2. It provides a single place to look for local variables
3. Easy to avoid unwanted global variables
4. It reduces the possibility of unwanted re-declarations

#### Q. What are the benefits of initializing variables?
It is recommended to initialize variables because of the below benefits,
1. It gives cleaner code
2. It provides a single place to initialize variables
3. Avoid undefined values in the code

#### Q. What are the recommendations to create new object?
It is recommended to avoid creating new objects using `new Object()`. Instead you can initialize values based on it's type to create the objects.
1. Assign {} instead of new Object()
2. Assign "" instead of new String()
3. Assign 0 instead of new Number()
4. Assign false instead of new Boolean()
5. Assign [] instead of new Array()
6. Assign /()/ instead of new RegExp()
7. Assign function (){} instead of new Function()

You can define them as an example,

```javascript
var v1 = {};
var v2 = "";
var v3 = 0;
var v4 = false;
var v5 = [];
var v6 = /()/;
var v7 = function(){};
```
#### Q. How do you define JSON arrays?
JSON arrays are written inside square brackets and array contain javascript objects. For example, the JSON array of users would be as below,
```javascript
"users":[
  {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Abrahm"},
  {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
  {"firstName":"Shane", "lastName":"Warn"}
]
```
#### Q. How do you generate random integers?
You can use Math.random() with Math.floor() to return random integers. For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, the multiplication factor should be 10,
```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;     // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;     // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
```
**Note:** Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive),  and 1 (exclusive)

#### Q. Can you write a random integers function to print integers with in a range?
Yes, you can create a proper random function to return a random number between min and max (both included)
```javascript
function randomInteger(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) ) + min;
}
randomInteger(1, 100); // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
randomInteger(1, 1000); // returns a random integer from 1 to 1000
```
#### Q. What is tree shaking?
Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler `rollup`.

#### Q. What is the need of tree shaking?
Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around  few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is been implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.

#### Q. Is it recommended to use eval?
No, it allows arbitrary code to be run which casues a security problem. As we know that the eval() function is used to run text as code. In most of the cases, it should not be necessary to use it.

#### Q. What is a Regular Expression?
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the syntax format now,
```javascript
/pattern/modifiers;
```
For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive username would be,
```javascript
/John/i
```
#### Q. What are the string methods available in Regular expression?
Regular Expressions has two string methods: search() and replace().
The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.
```javascript
var msg = "Hello John";
var n = msg.search(/John/i); // 6
```
The replace() method is used return a modified string where the pattern is replaced.
```javascript
var msg = "Hello John";
var n = msg.search(/John/i, "Buttler"); // Hello Buttler
```
#### Q. What are modifiers in regular expression?
  Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive and global searches. Let's list down some of the modifiers,

  | Modifier | Description |
  |---- | ---------
  | i  | Perform case-insensitive matching |
  | g | 	Perform a global match rather than stops at first match  |
  | m | Perform multiline matching|

Let's take an example of global modifier,
```javascript
  var text = "Learn JS one by one";
  var pattern = /one/g;
  var result = text.match(pattern); // one,one
```
#### Q. What are regular expression patterns?
Regular Expressions provided group of patterns in order to match characters. Basically they are categorized into 3 types,
1. **Brackets:** These are used to find a range of characters.
  For example, below are some use cases,
  1. [abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)
  2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
  3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |
2. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning
  For example, below are some use cases,
  1. \d: Used to find a digit
  2. \s: Used to find a whitespace character
  3. \b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities
  For example, below are some use cases,
  1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
  2. n*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
  3. n?: Used to find	matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

#### Q. What is a RegExp object?
RegExp object is a regular expression object with predefined properties and methods. Let's see the simple usage of RegExp object,
```javascript
var regexp = new RegExp('\\w+');
console.log(regexp);
// expected output: /\w+/
```
#### Q. How do you search a string for a pattern?
You can use test() method of regular expression in order to search a string for a pattern, and returns true or false depending on the result.
```javascript
var pattern = /you/;
console.log(pattern.test("How are you?")); //true
```
#### Q. What is the purpose of exec method?
The purpose of exec method is similar to test method but it returns a founded text as an object instead of returning true/false.
```javascript
var pattern = /you/;
console.log(pattern.test("How are you?")); //you
```
#### Q. How do you change style of a HTML element?
You can change inline style or classname of a HTML element using javascript
1. ** Using style property:** You can modify inline style using style property
```javascript
document.getElementById("title").style.fontSize = "30px";
```
2. ** Using ClassName property:** It is easy to modify element class using className property
```javascript
document.getElementById("title").style.className = "custom-title";
```
#### Q. What would be the result of 1+2+'3'?
The output is going to be `33`. Since `1` and `2` are numeric values, the result of first two digits is going to be a numeric value `3`. The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition of numeric value `3` and string type value `3` is just going to be a concatenation value `33`.

#### Q. What is a debugger statement?
The debugger statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.
For example, in the below function a debugger statement has been inserted. So execution is paused at the debugger statement just like a breakpoint in the script source.
```javascript
function getProfile() {
// code goes here
debugger;
// code goes here
}
```
#### Q. What is the purpose of breakpoints in debugging?
You can set breakpoints in the javascript code once the debugger statement is executed and debugger window pops up. At each breakpoint, javascript will stop executing, and let you examine the JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code using play button.

#### Q. Can I use reserved words as identifiers?
No, you cannot use the reserved words as variables, labels, object or function names. Let's see one simple example,
```javascript
var else = "hello"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token else
```

#### Q. How do you detect a mobile browser without regexp?
You can detect mobile browser by simply running through a list of devices and checking if the useragent matches anything. This is an alternative solution for RegExp usage,
```javascript
function detectmob() {
if( navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)
|| navigator.userAgent.match(/webOS/i)
|| navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i)
|| navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i)
|| navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i)
|| navigator.userAgent.match(/BlackBerry/i)
|| navigator.userAgent.match(/Windows Phone/i)
){
    return true;
  }
else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
#### Q. How do you get the image width and height using JS?
You can programmatically get the image and check the dimensions(width and height) using Javascript.
```javascript
var img = new Image();
img.onload = function() {
  console.log(this.width + 'x' + this.height);
}
img.src = 'http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif';
```

#### Q. How do you make synchronous HTTP request?
Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make synchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript
```javascript
function httpGet(theUrl)
{
    var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttpReq.open( "GET", theUrl, false ); // false for synchronous request
    xmlHttpReq.send( null );
    return xmlHttpReq.responseText;
}
```
#### Q. How do you make asynchronous HTTP request?
Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make asynchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript by passing 3rd parameter as true.
```javascript
function httpGetAsync(theUrl, callback)
{
    var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpReq.status == 200)
            callback(xmlHttpReq.responseText);
    }
    xmlHttp.open("GET", theUrl, true); // true for asynchronous
    xmlHttp.send(null);
}
```
#### Q. How do you convert date to another timezone in javascript?
You can use toLocaleString() method to convert date in one timezone to another. For example, let's convert current date to British English timezone as below,
```javascript
console.log(event.toLocaleString('en-GB', { timeZone: 'UTC' })); //29/06/2019, 09:56:00
```
#### Q. What are the properties used to get size of window?
You can use innerWidth, innerHeight, clientWidth, clientHeight properties of windows, document element and document body objects to find the size of a window. Let's use them combination of these properties to calculate the size of a window or document,
```javascript
var width = window.innerWidth
|| document.documentElement.clientWidth
|| document.body.clientWidth;

var height = window.innerHeight
|| document.documentElement.clientHeight
|| document.body.clientHeight;
```
#### Q. What is a conditional operator in javascript?
The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands which acts as a shortcut for if statement.
```javascript
var isAuthenticated = false;
console.log(isAuthenticated ? 'Hello, welcome' : 'Sorry, you are not authenticated'); //Sorry, you are not authenticated
```
#### Q. Can you apply chaining on conditional operator?
Yes, you can apply chaining on conditional operator similar to if … else if … else if … else chain. The syntax is going to be as below,
```javascript
function traceValue(someParam) {
    return condition1 ? value1
        : condition2 ? value2
        : condition3 ? value3
        : value4;
}

// The above conditional operator is equivalent to:

function traceValue(someParam) {
    if (condition1) { return value1; }
    else if (condition2) { return value2; }
    else if (condition3) { return value3; }
    else { return value4; }
}
```
#### Q. What are the ways to execute javascript after page load?
You can execute javascript after page load in many different ways,
1. ** window.onload:**
```javascript
window.onload = function ...
```
2. **document.onload:**
```javascript
document.onload = function ...
```
3. ** body onload:**
```javascript
<body onload="script();">
```
#### Q. What is the difference between proto and prototype?
The `__proto__` object is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. Whereas `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with new
```javascript
( new Employee ).__proto__ === Employee.prototype;
( new Employee ).prototype === undefined;
```
#### Q. Give an example where do you really need semicolon?
It is recommended to use semicolons after every statement in JavaScript. For example, in the below case it throws an error ".. is not a function" at runtime due to missing semicolon.
```javascript
// define a function
var fn = function () {
    //...
} // semicolon missing at this line

// then execute some code inside a closure
(function () {
    //...
})();
```
and it will be interpreted as
```javascript
var fn = function () {
    //...
}(function () {
    //...
})();
```
In this case, we are passing second function as an argument to the first function and then trying to call the result of the first function call as a function. Hence, the second function will fail with a "... is not a function" error at runtime.

#### Q. What is a freeze method?
The freeze() method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does'nt allow adding new properties to an object,prevents from removing and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e, It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.
```javascript
const obj = {
  prop: 100
};

Object.freeze(obj);
obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode

console.log(obj.prop); //100
```
**Note:** It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.

#### Q. What is the purpose of freeze method?
Below are the main benefits of using freeze method,
1. It is used for freezing objects and arrays.
2. It is used to make an object immutable.

#### Q. Why do I need to use freeze method?
In Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain elements that are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used outside of their current context. Hence it works as `final` keyword which is used in various languages.

#### Q. How do you detect a browser language preference?
You can use navigator object to detect a browser language preference as below,
```javascript
var language = navigator.languages && navigator.languages[0] || // Chrome / Firefox
              navigator.language ||   // All browsers
              navigator.userLanguage; // IE <= 10

console.log(language);
```
#### Q. How to convert string to title case with javascript?
Title case means that the first letter of each word is capitalized. You can convert a string to title case using the below function,
```javascript
    function toTitleCase(str) {
        return str.replace(
            /\w\S*/g,
            function(txt) {
                return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1).toLowerCase();
            }
        );
    }
    toTitleCase("good morning john"); // Good Morning John
```
#### Q. How do you detect javascript disabled in the page?
You can use `<noscript>` tag to detect javascript disabled or not. The code block inside `<noscript>` get executed when JavaScript is disabled, and are typically used to display alternative content when the page generated in JavaScript.
```javascript
<script type="javascript">
    // JS related code goes here
</script>
<noscript>
    <a href="next_page.html?noJS=true">JavaScript is disabled in the apge. Please click Next Page</a>
</noscript>
```
#### Q. What are various operators supported by javascript?
An operator is capable of manipulating(mathematical and logical computations) a certain value or operand. There are various operators supported by JavaScript as below,
1. **Arithmetic Operators:** Includes + (Addition),– (Subtraction), * (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), + + (Increment)  and – – (Decrement)
2. **Comparison Operators:** Includes = =(Equal),!= (Not Equal), ===(Equal with type), > (Greater than),> = (Greater than or Equal to),< (Less than),<= (Less than or Equal to)
3. **Logical Operators:** Includes &&(Logical AND),||(Logical OR),!(Logical NOT)
4. **Assignment Operators:** Includes = (Assignment Operator), += (Add and Assignment Operator), – = (Subtract and Assignment Operator), *= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment), %= (Modules and Assignment)
5. **Ternary Operators:** It includes conditional(: ?) Operator
6. **typeof Operator:** It uses to find type of variable. The syntax looks like `typeof variable`

#### Q. What is a rest parameter?
Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameter which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,
```javascript
function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
  // ...
}
```
For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,
```javascript
function total(…args){
let sum = 0;
for(let i of args){
sum+=i;
}
return sum;
}
console.log(fun(1,2)); //3
console.log(fun(1,2,3)); //6
console.log(fun(1,2,3,4)); //13
console.log(fun(1,2,3,4,5)); //15
```
**Note:** Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

#### Q. What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument?
The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense and will throw an error.
```javascript
function someFunc(a,…b,c){
//You code goes here
return;
}
```
#### Q. What are the bitwise operators available in javascript?
Below are the list of bit-wise logical operators used in JavaScript
1. Bit-wise AND ( & )
2. Bit-Wise OR ( | )
3. Bit-Wise XOR ( ^ )
4. Bit-Wise NOT ( ~ )
5. Left Shift ( << )
6. Sign Propagating Right Shift ( >> )
7. Zero fill Right Shift ( >>> )

#### Q. What is a spread operator?
Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. Let's take an example to see this behavior,
```javascript
function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6
```
#### Q. How do you determine whether object is frozen or not?
Object.isFrozen() method is used to determine if an object is frozen or not.An object is frozen if all of the below conditions hold true,
1. If it is not extensible.
2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
3. If all its data properties are non-writable.
The usage is going to be as follows,
```javascript
const object = {
  property: 'Welcome JS world'
};
Object.freeze(object);
console.log(Object.isFrozen(object));
```
#### Q. How do you determine two values same or not using object?
The Object.is() method determines whether two values are the same value. For example, the usage with different types of values would be,
```javascript
Object.is('hello', 'hello');     // true
Object.is(window, window);   // true
Object.is([], []) // false
```
Two values are the same if one of the following holds:
1. both undefined
2. both null
3. both true or both false
4. both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order
5. both the same object (means both object have same reference)
6. both numbers and
  both +0
  both -0
  both NaN
  both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value

#### Q. What is the purpose of using object is method?
Some of the applications of Object's `is` method are follows,
1. It is used for comparison of two strings.
2. It is used for comparison of two numbers.
3. It is used for comparing the polarity of two numbers.
4. It is used for comparison of two objects.

#### Q. How do you copy properties from one object to other?
You can use Object.assign() method which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object.  It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the target object. The syntax would be as below,
```javascript
Object.assign(target, ...sources)
```
Let's take exampple with one source and one target object,
```javascript
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };

const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 5 }

console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 5 }
```
As observed in the above code, there is a common property(`b`) from source to target so it's value is been overwritten.

#### Q. What are the applications of assign method?
Below are the some of main applications of Object.assign() method,
1. It is used for cloning an object.
2. It is used to merge object with same properties.

#### Q. What is a proxy object?
The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations such as property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc. The syntax would be as follows,
```javascript
var p = new Proxy(target, handler);
```
Let's take an example of proxy object,
```javascript
var handler = {
    get: function(obj, prop) {
        return prop in obj ?
            obj[prop] :
            100;
    }
};

var p = new Proxy({}, handler);
p.a = 10;
p.b = null;

console.log(p.a, p.b); // 1, null
console.log('c' in p, p.c); // false, 100
```
In the above code, it uses `get` handler which define the behavior of the proxy when an operation is performed on it

#### Q. What is the purpose of seal method?
The Object.seal() method is used seal an object, by preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. But values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable. Let's see the below example to understand more about seal() method
```javascript
const object = {
    property: 'Welcome JS world'
};
Object.freeze(object);
object.property = 'Welcome to object world';
console.log(Object.isFrozen(object)); // Welcome to object world
delete object.property; // You cannot delete when sealed
console.log(object.property); //Welcome to object world
```
#### Q. What are the applications of seal method?
Below are the main applications of Object.seal() method,
1. It is used for sealing objects and arrays.
2. It is used to make an object immutable.

#### Q. What are the differences between freeze and seal methods?
If an object is frozen using the Object.freeze() method then its properties become immutable and no changes can be made in them whereas if an object is sealed using the Object.seal() method then the changes can be made in the existing properties of the object.

#### Q. How do you determine if an object is sealed or not?
The Object.isSealed() method is used to determine if an object is sealed or not. An object is sealed if all of the below conditions hold true
1. If it is not extensible.
2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
3. If it is not removable (but not necessarily non-writable).
Let's see it in the action
```javascript
const object = {
property: 'Hello, Good morning'
};

Object.seal(object); // Using seal() method to seal the object

console.log(Object.isSealed(object));      // checking whether the object is sealed or not
```
#### Q. How do you get enumerable key and value pairs?
The Object.entries() method is used to return an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. Let's see the functionality of object.entries() method in an example,
```javascript
const object = {
  a: 'Good morning',
  b: 100
};

for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // a: 'Good morning'
                                  // b: 100
}
```
**Note:** The order is not guaranteed as object defined.

#### Q. What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method?
The Object.values() method's behavior is similar to Object.entries() method but it returns an array of values instead [key,value] pairs.
```javascript
const object = {
  a: 'Good morning',
  b: 100
};

for (let value of Object.values(object)) {
  console.log(`${value}`); // 'Good morning'
                                100
}
```
#### Q. How can you get the list of keys of any object?
You can use `Object.keys()` method which is used return an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,
```javascript
const user = {
  name: 'John',
  gender: 'male',
  age: 40
};

console.log(Object.keys(user)); //['name', 'gender', 'age']
```
#### Q. How do you create an object with prototype?
The Object.create() method is used to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. i.e, It uses existing object as the prototype of the newly created object. It returns a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.
```javascript
const user = {
  name: 'John',
  printInfo: function () {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
};

const admin = Object.create(person);

admin.name = "Nick"; // Remember that "name" is a property set on "admin" but not on "user" object

admin.printInfo(); // My name is Nick
```
#### Q. What is a WeakSet?
WeakSet is used to store a collection of weakly(weak references) held objects. The syntax would be as follows,
```javascript
new WeakSet([iterable]);
```
Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,
```javascript
var ws = new WeakSet();
var user = {};
ws.add(user);
ws.has(user);    // true
ws.delete(user); // removes user from the set
ws.has(user);    // false, user has been removed
```
#### Q. What are the differences between WeakSet and Set?
The main difference is that references to objects in Set are strong while references to objects in WeakSet are weak. i.e, An object in WeakSet can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.
Other differences are,
1. Sets can store any value Whereas WeakSets can store only collections of objects
2. WeakSet does not have size property unlike Set
3. WeakSet does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
4. WeakSet is not iterable.

#### Q. List down the collection of methods available on WeakSet?
Below are the list of methods available on WeakSet,
1. add(value): A new object is appended with the given value to the weakset
2. delete(value): Deletes the value from the WeakSet collection.
3. has(value): It returns true if the value is present in the WeakSet Collection, otherwise it returns false.
4. length(): It returns the length of weakSetObject
Let's see the functionality of all the above methods in an example,
```javascript
var weakSetObject = new WeakSet();
var firstObject = {};
var secondObject = {};
// add(value)
weakSetObject.add(firstObject);
weakSetObject.add(secondObject);
console.log(weakSetObject.has(firstObject)); //true
console.log(weakSetObject.length()); //2
weakSetObject.delete(secondObject);
```
#### Q. What is a WeakMap?
The WeakMap object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced. In this case, keys must be objects and the values can be arbitrary values. The syntax is looking like as below,
```javascript
new WeakMap([iterable])
```
Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,
```javascript
var ws = new WeakMap();
var user = {};
ws.set(user);
ws.has(user);    // true
ws.delete(user); // removes user from the map
ws.has(user);    // false, user has been removed
```
#### Q. What are the differences between WeakMap and Map?
The main difference is that references to key objects in Map are strong while references to key objects in WeakMap are weak. i.e, A key object in WeakMap can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.
Other differences are,
1. Maps can store any key type Whereas WeakMaps can store only collections of key objects
2. WeakMap does not have size property unlike Map
3. WeakMap does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
4. WeakMap is not iterable.

#### Q. List down the collection of methods available on WeakMap?
Below are the list of methods available on WeakMap,
1. set(key, value): Sets the value for the key in the WeakMap object. Returns the WeakMap object.
2. delete(key): Removes any value associated to the key.
3. has(key): Returns a Boolean asserting whether a value has been associated to the key in the WeakMap object or not.
4. get(key): Returns the value associated to the key, or undefined if there is none.
Let's see the functionality of all the above methods in an example,
```javascript
var weakMapObject = new WeakMap();
var firstObject = {};
var secondObject = {};
// set(key, value)
weakMapObject.set(firstObject, 'John');
weakMapObject.set(secondObject, 100);
console.log(weakMapObject.has(firstObject)); //true
console.log(weakMapObject.get(firstObject)); // John
weakMapObject.delete(secondObject);
```
#### Q. What is the purpose of uneval?
The uneval() is an inbuilt function which is used to create a string representation of the source code of an Object. It is a top-level function and is not associated with any object. Let's see the below example to know more about it's functionality,
```javascript
var a = 1;
uneval(a); // returns a String containing 1
uneval(function user() {}); // returns "(function user(){})"
```
#### Q. How do you encode an URL?
The encodeURI() function is used to encode complete URI which has special characters except (, / ? : @ & = + $ #) characters.
```javascript
var uri = 'https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы';
var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B
```
#### Q. How do you decode an URL?
The decodeURI() function is used to decode a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI().
```javascript
var uri = 'https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы';
var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B
try {
  console.log(decodeURI(encoded)); // "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы"
} catch(e) { // catches a malformed URI
  console.error(e);
}
```
#### Q. How do you print the contents of web page?
The window object provided print() method which is used to prints the contents of the current window. It opens Print dialog box which lets you choose between various printing options. Let's see the usage of print method in an example,
```html
  <input type="button" value="Print" onclick="window.print()" />
```
**Note:** In most browsers, it will block while the print dialog is open.

#### Q. What is the difference between uneval and eval?
The `uneval` function returns the source of a given object; whereas the `eval` function does the opposite, by evaluating that source code in a different memory area. Let's see an example to clarify the difference,
```javascript
var msg = uneval(function greeting() { return 'Hello, Good morning'; });
var greeting = eval(msg);
greeting(); // returns "Hello, Good morning"
```
#### Q. What is an anonymous function?
An anonymous function is a function without a name! Anonymous functions are commonly assigned to a variable name or used as a callback function. The syntax would be as below,
```javascript
function (optionalParameters) {
  //do something
}

const myFunction = function(){ //Anonymous function assigned to a variable
  //do something
};

[1, 2, 3].map(function(element){ //Anonymous function used as a callback function
  //do something
});
```
Let's see the above anonymous function in an example,
```javascript
var x = function (a, b) {return a * b};
var z = x(5, 10);
console.log(z); // 50
```
#### Q. What is the precedence order between local and global variables?
A local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. Let's see this behavior in an example.
```javascript
var msg = "Good morning";
function greeting() {
  msg = "Good Evening";
  console.log(msg);
}
greeting();
```
#### Q. What are javascript accessors?
ECMAScript 5 introduced javascript object accessors or computed properties through getters and setters. Getters uses `get` keyword whereas Setters uses `set` keyword.
```javascript
var user = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Abraham",
  language : "en",
  get lang() {
    return this.language;
  }
  set lang(lang) {
  this.language = lang;
  }
};
console.log(user.lang); // getter access lang as en
user.lang = 'fr';
console.log(user.lang); // setter used to set lang as fr
```
#### Q. How do you define property on Object constructor?
The Object.defineProperty() static method is used to define a new property directly on an object, or modifies an existing property on an object, and returns the object. Let's see an example to know how to define property,
```javascript
const newObject = {};

Object.defineProperty(newObject, 'newProperty', {
  value: 100,
  writable: false
});

console.log(newObject.newProperty); // 100

newObject.newProperty = 200; // It throws an error in strict mode due to writable setting

```
#### Q. What is the difference between get and defineProperty?
Both has similar results until unless you use classes. If you use `get` the property will be defined on the prototype of the object whereas using `Object.defineProperty()` the property will be defined on the instance it is applied to.

#### Q. What are the advantages of Getters and Setters?
Below are the list of benefits of Getters and Setters,
1. They provide simpler syntax
2. They are used for defining computed properties, or accessors in JS.
3. Useful to provide equivalence relation between properties and methods
4. They can provide better data quality
5. Useful for doing things behind the scenes with the encapsulated logic.

#### Q. Can I add getters and setters using defineProperty method?
Yes, You can use `Object.defineProperty()` method to add Getters and Setters. For example, the below counter object uses increment, decrement, add and substract properties,
```javascript
var counterObj = {counter : 0};

// Define getters
Object.defineProperty(obj, "increment", {
  get : function () {this.counter++;}
});
Object.defineProperty(obj, "decrement", {
  get : function () {this.counter--;}
});

// Define setters
Object.defineProperty(obj, "add", {
  set : function (value) {this.counter += value;}
});
Object.defineProperty(obj, "subtract", {
  set : function (value) {this.counter -= value;}
});

obj.add = 10;
obj.subtract = 5;
console.log(obj.increment); //6
console.log(obj.decrement); //5
```
#### Q. What is the purpose of switch-case?
The switch case statement in JavaScript is used for decision making purposes. In few cases, using the switch case statement is going to be more convenient than if-else statements. The syntax would be as below,
```javascript
switch (expression)
{
    case value1:
        statement1;
        break;
    case value2:
        statement2;
        break;
    .
    .
    case valueN:
        statementN;
        break;
    default:
        statementDefault;
}
```
The above multi-way branch statement provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.

#### Q. What are the conventions to be followed for the usage of swtich case?
Below are the list of conventions should be taken care,
1. The expression can be of type either number or string.
2. Duplicate values are not allowed for the expression.
3. The default statement is optional. If the expression passed to switch does not matches with any case value then the statement within default case will be executed.
4. The break statement is used inside the switch to terminate a statement sequence.
5. The break statement is optional. But if it omitted, the execution will continue on into the next case.

#### Q. What are primitive data types?
A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value (which has no properties or methods). There are 5 types of primitive data types.
1. string
2. number
3. boolean
4. null
5. undefined

#### Q. What are the different ways to access object properties?
There are 3 possible ways for accessing the property of an object.
1. **Dot notation:** It uses dot for accessing the properties
```javascript
objectName.property
```
2. **Square brackets notation:** It uses square brackets for property access
```javascript
objectName["property"]
```
3. **Expression notation:** It uses expression in the square brackets
```javascript
objectName[expression]
```
#### Q. What are the function parameter rules?
JavaScript functions follow below rules for parameters,
1. The function definitions do not specify data types for parameters.
2. Do not perform type checking on the passed arguments.
3. Do not check the number of arguments received.
i.e, The below function follows the above rules,
```javascript
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  console.log(parameter1); // 1
}
functionName(1);
```
#### Q. What is an error object?
An error object is a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs. It has two properties: name and message. For example, the below function logs error details,
```javascript
try {
  greeting("Welcome");
}
catch(err) {
  console.log(err.name + "<br>" + err.message);
}
```
#### Q. When you get a syntax error?
A SyntaxError is thrown if you try to evaluate code with a syntax error. For example, the below missing quote for the function parameter throws a syntax error
```javascript
try {
  eval("greeting('welcome)");   // Missing ' will produce an error
}
catch(err) {
  console.log(err.name);
}
```
#### Q. What are the different error names from error object?
There are 6 different types of error names returned from error object,
| Error Name | Description |
|---- | ---------
| EvalError  | An error has occurred in the eval() function |
| RangeError | An error has occurred with a number "out of range"  |
| ReferenceError | An error due to an illegal reference|
| SyntaxError | An error due to a syntax error|
| TypeError | An error due to a type error |
| URIError | An error due to encodeURI() |

#### Q. What are the various statements in error handling?
Below are the list of statements used in an error handling,
1. **try:** This statement is used to test a block of code for errors
2. **catch:** This statement is used to handle the error
3. **throw:** This statement is used to create custom errors.
4. **finally:** This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

#### Q. What are the two types of loops in javascript?
1. **Entry Controlled loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For example, For Loop and While Loop comes under this category.
2. **Exit Controlled Loops:** In this kind of loop typpe, the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of loop body. i.e, the loop body will execute atleast once irrespective of test condition true or false. For example, do-while loop comes under this category.

#### Q. What is nodejs?
Node.js is a server-side platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. It is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

#### Q. What is an Intl object?
The Intl object is the namespace for the ECMAScript Internationalization API, which provides language sensitive string comparison, number formatting, and date and time formatting. It provides an access to several constructors and language sensitive functions.

#### Q. How do you perform language specific date and time formatting?
You can use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` object which is constructor for objects that enable language-sensitive date and time formatting. Let's see this behavior with an example,
```javascript
var date = new Date(Date.UTC(2019, 07, 07, 3, 0, 0));
console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-GB').format(date)); // 07/08/2019
console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-AU').format(date)); // 07/08/2019
```
#### Q. What is an Iterator?
an iterator is an object which defines a sequence and a return value upon its termination. It implements the Iterator protocol with a next() method which returns an object with two properties: value (the next value in the sequence) and done (which is true if the last value in the sequence has been consumed).

#### Q. What is an event loop?
The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until async function has finished executing the code.
**Note:** It allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations eventhough JavaScript is single-threaded.

#### Q. What is a decorator?
A decorator is an expression that evaluates to a function and that takes the target, name, and decorator descriptor as arguments. Also, it optionally returns a decorator descriptor to install on the target object. Let's define admin decorator for user class at design time,
```javascript
function admin(isAdmin) {
  return function(target) {
      target.isAdmin = isAdmin;
  }
}

@admin(true)
class User() {
}
console.log(User.isAdmin); //true

@admin(false)
class User() {
}
console.log(User.isAdmin); //false
```
#### Q. What are the properties of Intl object?
Below are the list of properties available on Intl object,
1. **Collator:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive string comparison.
2. **DateTimeFormat:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive date and time formatting.
3. **ListFormat:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive list formatting.
4. **NumberFormat:** Objects that enable language-sensitive number formatting.
5. **PluralRules:** Objects that enable plural-sensitive formatting and language-specific rules for plurals.
6. **RelativeTimeFormat:** Objects that enable language-sensitive relative time formatting.

#### Q. What is an Unary operator?
The unary(+) operator is used to convert a variable to a number.If the variable cannot be converted, it will still become a number but with the value NaN. Let's see this behavior in an action.
```javascrippt
var x = "100";
var y = + x;
console.log(typeof x, typeof y); // string, number

var a = "Hello";
var b = + a;
console.log(typeof a, typeof b, b); // string, number, NaN
```
#### Q. How do you sort elements in an array?
The sort() method is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The example usage would be as below,
```javascript
var months = ["Aug", "Sep", "Jan", "June"];
months.sort();
console.log(months); //  ["Aug", "Jan", "June", "Sep"]
```
#### Q. What is the purpose of compareFunction while sorting arrays?
The compareFunction is used to define the sort order. If omitted, the array elements are converted to strings, then sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value. Let's take an example to see the usage of compareFunction,
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.log(numbers); // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
#### Q. How do you reversing an array?
You can use reverse() method is used reverse the elements in an array. This method is useful to sort an array in descending order. Let's see the usage of reverse() method in an example,
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
numbers.reverse();
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]
```
#### Q. How do you find min and max value in an array?
You can use `Math.min` and `Math.max` methods on array variable to find the minimum and maximum elements with in an array. Let's create two functions to find the min and max value with in an array,
```javascript
var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
function findMin(arr) {
  return Math.min.apply(null, arr);
}
function findMax(arr) {
  return Math.max.apply(null, arr);
}

console.log(findMin(marks));
console.log(findMax(marks));
```
#### Q. How do you find min and max values without Math functions?
You can write functions which loops through an array comparing each value with the lowest value or highest value to find the min and max values. Let's create those functions to find min an max values,
```javascript
var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
function findMin(arr) {
  var length = arr.length
  var min = Infinity;
  while (length--) {
    if (arr[length] < min) {
      min = arr[len];
    }
  }
  return min;
}

function findMax(arr) {
  var length = arr.length
  var max = -Infinity;
  while (len--) {
    if (arr[length] > max) {
      max = arr[length];
    }
  }
  return max;
}

console.log(findMin(marks));
console.log(findMax(marks));
```
#### Q. What is an empty statement and purpose of it?
The empty statement is a semicolon (;) indicating that no statement will be executed, even if JavaScript syntax requires one. Since there is no action with an empty statement you might think that it's usage is quite less, but the empty statement is occasionally useful when you want to create a loop that has an empty body. For example, you can initialize an array with zero values as below,
```javascript
// Initialize an array a
for(int i=0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0) ;
```
#### Q. How do you get meta data of a module?
You can use `import.meta` object which is a meta-property exposing context-specific meta data to a JavaScript module. It contains information about the current module, such as module's URL. In browser, you might get different meta data than NodeJS.
```javascript
<script type="module" src="welcome-module.js"></script>
console.log(import.meta); // { url: "file:///home/user/welcome-module.js" }
```
#### Q. What is a comma operator?
The comma operator is used to evaluate each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand. This is totally different from comma usage within arrays, objects, and function arguments and parameters. For example, the usage for numeric expressions would be as below,
```javascript
var x = 1;
x = (x++, x);

console.log(x); // 2
```
#### Q. What is the advantage of a comma operator?
It is normally used to include multiple expressions in a location that requires a single expression. One of the common usage of this comma operator is to supply multiple parameters in a `for` loop. For example, the below for loop uses multiple expressions in a single location using comma operator,
```javascript
for (var a = 0, b =10; a <= 10; a++, b--)
```
You can also use the comma operator in a return statement where it process before returning.
```javascript
function myFunction() {
  var a = 1;
  return (a += 10, a); // 11
}
```
#### Q. Explain event delegation

Event delegation is a technique involving adding event listeners to a parent element instead of adding them to the descendant elements. The listener will fire whenever the event is triggered on the descendant elements due to event bubbling up the DOM. The benefits of this technique are:

* Memory footprint goes down because only one single handler is needed on the parent element, rather than having to attach event handlers on each descendant.
* There is no need to unbind the handler from elements that are removed and to bind the event for new elements.


#### Q. Explain how prototypal inheritance works

This is an extremely common JavaScript interview question. All JavaScript objects have a `prototype` property, that is a reference to another object. When a property is accessed on an object and if the property is not found on that object, the JavaScript engine looks at the object's `prototype`, and the `prototype`'s `prototype` and so on, until it finds the property defined on one of the `prototype`s or until it reaches the end of the prototype chain. This behavior simulates classical inheritance, but it is really more of [delegation than inheritance](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects).

#### Q. Example of Prototypal Inheritance

We already have a build-in `Object.create`, but if you were to provide a polyfill for it, that might look like:

```javascript
if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') {
  Object.create = function (parent) {
    function Tmp() {}
    Tmp.prototype = parent;
    return new Tmp();
  };
}

const Parent = function() {
  this.name = "Parent";
}

Parent.prototype.greet = function() { console.log("hello from Parent"); }

const child = Object.create(Parent.prototype);

child.cry = function() {
  console.log("waaaaaahhhh!");
}

child.cry();
// Outputs: waaaaaahhhh!

child.greet();
// Outputs: hello from Parent
```

Things to note are:

* `.greet` is not defined on the _child_, so the engine goes up the prototype chain and finds `.greet` off the inherited from _Parent_.
* We need to call `Object.create` in one of following ways for the prototype methods to be inherited:
  * Object.create(Parent.prototype);
  * Object.create(new Parent(null));
  * Object.create(objLiteral);
  * Currently, `child.constructor` is pointing to the `Parent`:

```javascript
child.constructor
ƒ () {
  this.name = "Parent";
}
child.constructor.name
"Parent"
```
  * If we'd like to correct this, one option would be to do:

```javascript
function Child() {
  Parent.call(this);
  this.name = 'child';
}

Child.prototype = Parent.prototype;
Child.prototype.constructor = Child;

const c = new Child();

c.cry();
// Outputs: waaaaaahhhh!

c.greet();
// Outputs: hello from Parent

c.constructor.name;
// Outputs: "Child"
```

#### Q. What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?

Both are ways to implement a module system, which was not natively present in JavaScript until ES2015 came along. CommonJS is synchronous while AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) is obviously asynchronous. CommonJS is designed with server-side development in mind while AMD, with its support for asynchronous loading of modules, is more intended for browsers.

I find AMD syntax to be quite verbose and CommonJS is closer to the style you would write import statements in other languages. Most of the time, I find AMD unnecessary, because if you served all your JavaScript into one concatenated bundle file, you wouldn't benefit from the async loading properties. Also, CommonJS syntax is closer to Node style of writing modules and there is less context-switching overhead when switching between client side and server side JavaScript development.

I'm glad that with ES2015 modules, that has support for both synchronous and asynchronous loading, we can finally just stick to one approach. Although it hasn't been fully rolled out in browsers and in Node, we can always use transpilers to convert our code.


#### Q. Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: `function foo(){ }();`. What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?

IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions. The JavaScript parser reads `function foo(){ }();` as `function foo(){ }` and `();`, where the former is a *function declaration* and the latter (a pair of parentheses) is an attempt at calling a function but there is no name specified, hence it throws `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )`.

Here are two ways to fix it that involves adding more parentheses: `(function foo(){ })()` and `(function foo(){ }())`. Statements that begin with `function` are considered to be *function declarations*; by wrapping this function within `()`, it becomes a *function expression* which can then be executed with the subsequent `()`. These functions are not exposed in the global scope and you can even omit its name if you do not need to reference itself within the body.

You might also use `void` operator: `void function foo(){ }();`. Unfortunately, there is one issue with such approach. The evaluation of given expression is always `undefined`, so if your IIFE function returns anything, you can't use it. An example:

```
// Don't add JS syntax to this code block to prevent Prettier from formatting it.
const foo = void function bar() { return 'foo'; }();

console.log(foo); // undefined
```

#### Q. What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or undeclared? How would you go about checking for any of these states?

**Undeclared** variables are created when you assign a value to an identifier that is not previously created using `var`, `let` or `const`. Undeclared variables will be defined globally, outside of the current scope. In strict mode, a `ReferenceError` will be thrown when you try to assign to an undeclared variable. Undeclared variables are bad just like how global variables are bad. Avoid them at all cost! To check for them, wrap its usage in a `try`/`catch` block.

```js
function foo() {
  x = 1; // Throws a ReferenceError in strict mode
}

foo();
console.log(x); // 1
```

A variable that is `undefined` is a variable that has been declared, but not assigned a value. It is of type `undefined`. If a function does not return any value as the result of executing it is assigned to a variable, the variable also has the value of `undefined`. To check for it, compare using the strict equality (`===`) operator or `typeof` which will give the `'undefined'` string. Note that you should not be using the abstract equality operator to check, as it will also return `true` if the value is `null`.

```js
var foo;
console.log(foo); // undefined
console.log(foo === undefined); // true
console.log(typeof foo === 'undefined'); // true

console.log(foo == null); // true. Wrong, don't use this to check!

function bar() {}
var baz = bar();
console.log(baz); // undefined
```

A variable that is `null` will have been explicitly assigned to the `null` value. It represents no value and is different from `undefined` in the sense that it has been explicitly assigned. To check for `null,` simply compare using the strict equality operator. Note that like the above, you should not be using the abstract equality operator (`==`) to check, as it will also return `true` if the value is `undefined`.

```js
var foo = null;
console.log(foo === null); // true
console.log(typeof foo === 'object'); // true

console.log(foo == undefined); // true. Wrong, don't use this to check!
```

As a personal habit, I never leave my variables undeclared or unassigned. I will explicitly assign `null` to them after declaring if I don't intend to use it yet. If you use a linter in your workflow, it will usually also be able to check that you are not referencing undeclared variables.

#### Q. What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—scope chain even after the outer function has returned.

**Why would you use one?**

* Data privacy / emulating private methods with closures. Commonly used in the [module pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript).
* [Partial applications or currying](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/curry-or-partial-application-8150044c78b8#.l4b6l1i3x).


#### Q. Can you describe the main difference between a `.forEach` loop and a `.map()` loop and why you would pick one versus the other?

To understand the differences between the two, let's look at what each function does.

**`forEach`**

* Iterates through the elements in an array.
* Executes a callback for each element.
* Does not return a value.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = a.forEach((num, index) => {
  // Do something with num and/or index.
});

// doubled = undefined
```

**`map`**

* Iterates through the elements in an array.
* "Maps" each element to a new element by calling the function on each element, creating a new array as a result.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = a.map(num => {
  return num * 2;
});

// doubled = [2, 4, 6]
```

The main difference between `.forEach` and `.map()` is that `.map()` returns a new array. If you need the result, but do not wish to mutate the original array, `.map()` is the clear choice. If you simply need to iterate over an array, `forEach` is a fine choice.

#### Q. What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?

They can be used in IIFEs to encapsulate some code within a local scope so that variables declared in it do not leak to the global scope.

```js
(function() {
  // Some code here.
})();
```

As a callback that is used once and does not need to be used anywhere else. The code will seem more self-contained and readable when handlers are defined right inside the code calling them, rather than having to search elsewhere to find the function body.

```js
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}, 1000);
```

Arguments to functional programming constructs or Lodash (similar to callbacks).

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const double = arr.map(function(el) {
  return el * 2;
});
console.log(double); // [2, 4, 6]
```

#### Q. How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance?)

In the past, I've used Backbone for my models which encourages a more OOP approach, creating Backbone models and attaching methods to them.

The module pattern is still great, but these days, I use React/Redux which utilize a single-directional data flow based on Flux architecture. I would represent my app's models using plain objects and write utility pure functions to manipulate these objects. State is manipulated using actions and reducers like in any other Redux application.

I avoid using classical inheritance where possible. When and if I do, I stick to [these rules](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/how-to-use-classes-and-sleep-at-night-9af8de78ccb4).


#### Q. What's the difference between host objects and native objects?

Native objects are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification, such as `String`, `Math`, `RegExp`, `Object`, `Function`, etc.

Host objects are provided by the runtime environment (browser or Node), such as `window`, `XMLHTTPRequest`, etc.


### Difference between: `function Person(){}`, `var person = Person()`, and `var person = new Person()`?

This question is pretty vague. My best guess at its intention is that it is asking about constructors in JavaScript. Technically speaking, `function Person(){}` is just a normal function declaration. The convention is to use PascalCase for functions that are intended to be used as constructors.

`var person = Person()` invokes the `Person` as a function, and not as a constructor. Invoking as such is a common mistake if the function is intended to be used as a constructor. Typically, the constructor does not return anything, hence invoking the constructor like a normal function will return `undefined` and that gets assigned to the variable intended as the instance.

`var person = new Person()` creates an instance of the `Person` object using the `new` operator, which inherits from `Person.prototype`. An alternative would be to use `Object.create`, such as: `Object.create(Person.prototype)`.

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

var person = Person('John');
console.log(person); // undefined
console.log(person.name); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined

var person = new Person('John');
console.log(person); // Person { name: "John" }
console.log(person.name); // "john"
```

#### Q. What's the difference between `.call` and `.apply`?

Both `.call` and `.apply` are used to invoke functions and the first parameter will be used as the value of `this` within the function. However, `.call` takes in comma-separated arguments as the next arguments while `.apply` takes in an array of arguments as the next argument. An easy way to remember this is C for `call` and comma-separated and A for `apply` and an array of arguments.

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add.call(null, 1, 2)); // 3
console.log(add.apply(null, [1, 2])); // 3
```

#### Q. Explain `Function.prototype.bind`.

Taken word-for-word from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind):

> The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

In my experience, it is most useful for binding the value of `this` in methods of classes that you want to pass into other functions. This is frequently done in React components.


#### Q. When would you use `document.write()`?

`document.write()` writes a string of text to a document stream opened by `document.open()`. When `document.write()` is executed after the page has loaded, it will call `document.open` which clears the whole document (`<head>` and `<body>` removed!) and replaces the contents with the given parameter value. Hence it is usually considered dangerous and prone to misuse.

There are some answers online that explain `document.write()` is being used in analytics code or [when you want to include styles that should only work if JavaScript is enabled](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/06/three_javascrip_1.html). It is even being used in HTML5 boilerplate to [load scripts in parallel and preserve execution order](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/wiki/Script-Loading-Techniques#documentwrite-script-tag)! However, I suspect those reasons might be outdated and in the modern day, they can be achieved without using `document.write()`. Please do correct me if I'm wrong about this.

#### Q. What's the difference between feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string?

**Feature Detection**

Feature detection involves working out whether a browser supports a certain block of code, and running different code depending on whether it does (or doesn't), so that the browser can always provide a working experience rather crashing/erroring in some browsers. For example:

```js
if ('geolocation' in navigator) {
  // Can use navigator.geolocation
} else {
  // Handle lack of feature
}
```

[Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) is a great library to handle feature detection.

**Feature Inference**

Feature inference checks for a feature just like feature detection, but uses another function because it assumes it will also exist, e.g.:

```js
if (document.getElementsByTagName) {
  element = document.getElementById(id);
}
```

This is not really recommended. Feature detection is more foolproof.

**UA String**

This is a browser-reported string that allows the network protocol peers to identify the application type, operating system, software vendor or software version of the requesting software user agent. It can be accessed via `navigator.userAgent`. However, the string is tricky to parse and can be spoofed. For example, Chrome reports both as Chrome and Safari. So to detect Safari you have to check for the Safari string and the absence of the Chrome string. Avoid this method.


#### Q. Explain Ajax in as much detail as possible.

Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute use JSON instead of XML, due to the advantages of JSON being native to JavaScript.

The `XMLHttpRequest` API is frequently used for the asynchronous communication or these days, the `fetch` API.


#### Q. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Ajax?

**Advantages**

* Better interactivity. New content from the server can be changed dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.
* Reduce connections to the server since scripts and stylesheets only have to be requested once.
* State can be maintained on a page. JavaScript variables and DOM state will persist because the main container page was not reloaded.
* Basically most of the advantages of an SPA.

**Disadvantages**

* Dynamic webpages are harder to bookmark.
* Does not work if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.
* Some webcrawlers do not execute JavaScript and would not see content that has been loaded by JavaScript.
* Basically most of the disadvantages of an SPA.


#### Q. Explain how JSONP works (and how it's not really Ajax).

JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a method commonly used to bypass the cross-domain policies in web browsers because Ajax requests from the current page to a cross-origin domain is not allowed.

JSONP works by making a request to a cross-origin domain via a `<script>` tag and usually with a `callback` query parameter, for example: `https://example.com?callback=printData`. The server will then wrap the data within a function called `printData` and return it to the client.

```html
<!-- https://mydomain.com -->
<script>
function printData(data) {
  console.log(`My name is ${data.name}!`);
}
</script>

<script src="https://example.com?callback=printData"></script>
```

```js
// File loaded from https://example.com?callback=printData
printData({ name: 'Yang Shun' });
```

The client has to have the `printData` function in its global scope and the function will be executed by the client when the response from the cross-origin domain is received.

JSONP can be unsafe and has some security implications. As JSONP is really JavaScript, it can do everything else JavaScript can do, so you need to trust the provider of the JSONP data.

These days, [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) is the recommended approach and JSONP is seen as a hack.

#### Q. Have you ever used JavaScript templating? If so, what libraries have you used?

Yes. Handlebars, Underscore, Lodash, AngularJS, and JSX. I disliked templating in AngularJS because it made heavy use of strings in the directives and typos would go uncaught. JSX is my new favorite as it is closer to JavaScript and there is barely any syntax to learn. Nowadays, you can even use ES2015 template string literals as a quick way for creating templates without relying on third-party code.

```js
const template = `<div>My name is: ${name}</div>`;
```

However, do be aware of a potential XSS in the above approach as the contents are not escaped for you, unlike in templating libraries.


#### Q. Explain "hoisting".

Hoisting is a term used to explain the behavior of variable declarations in your code. Variables declared or initialized with the `var` keyword will have their declaration "moved" up to the top of the current scope, which we refer to as hoisting. However, only the declaration is hoisted, the assignment (if there is one), will stay where it is.

Note that the declaration is not actually moved - the JavaScript engine parses the declarations during compilation and becomes aware of declarations and their scopes. It is just easier to understand this behavior by visualizing the declarations as being hoisted to the top of their scope. Let's explain with a few examples.

```js
// var declarations are hoisted.
console.log(foo); // undefined
var foo = 1;
console.log(foo); // 1

// let/const declarations are NOT hoisted.
console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: bar is not defined
let bar = 2;
console.log(bar); // 2
```

Function declarations have the body hoisted while the function expressions (written in the form of variable declarations) only has the variable declaration hoisted.

```js
// Function Declaration
console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]
foo(); // 'FOOOOO'
function foo() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
}
console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]

// Function Expression
console.log(bar); // undefined
bar(); // Uncaught TypeError: bar is not a function
var bar = function() {
  console.log('BARRRR');
};
console.log(bar); // [Function: bar]
```

#### Q. Describe event bubbling.

When an event triggers on a DOM element, it will attempt to handle the event if there is a listener attached, then the event is bubbled up to its parent and the same thing happens. This bubbling occurs up the element's ancestors all the way to the `document`. Event bubbling is the mechanism behind event delegation.



#### Q. What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property"?

Attributes are defined on the HTML markup but properties are defined on the DOM. To illustrate the difference, imagine we have this text field in our HTML: `<input type="text" value="Hello">`.

```js
const input = document.querySelector('input');
console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello
```

But after you change the value of the text field by adding "World!" to it, this becomes:

```js
console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello World!
```


#### Q. Why is extending built-in JavaScript objects not a good idea?

Extending a built-in/native JavaScript object means adding properties/functions to its `prototype`. While this may seem like a good idea at first, it is dangerous in practice. Imagine your code uses a few libraries that both extend the `Array.prototype` by adding the same `contains` method, the implementations will overwrite each other and your code will break if the behavior of these two methods is not the same.

The only time you may want to extend a native object is when you want to create a polyfill, essentially providing your own implementation for a method that is part of the JavaScript specification but might not exist in the user's browser due to it being an older browser.


#### Q. Difference between document `load` event and document `DOMContentLoaded` event?

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

`window`'s `load` event is only fired after the DOM and all dependent resources and assets have loaded.


#### Q. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?

`==` is the abstract equality operator while `===` is the strict equality operator. The `==` operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions. The `===` operator will not do type conversion, so if two values are not the same type `===` will simply return `false`. When using `==`, funky things can happen, such as:

```js
1 == '1'; // true
1 == [1]; // true
1 == true; // true
0 == ''; // true
0 == '0'; // true
0 == false; // true
```

My advice is never to use the `==` operator, except for convenience when comparing against `null` or `undefined`, where `a == null` will return `true` if `a` is `null` or `undefined`.

```js
var a = null;
console.log(a == null); // true
console.log(a == undefined); // true
```

#### Q. Explain the same-origin policy with regards to JavaScript.

The same-origin policy prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. This policy prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through that page's Document Object Model.


#### Q. Make this work:

```js
duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
```

```js
function duplicate(arr) {
  return arr.concat(arr);
}

duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
```



#### Q. Why is it called a Ternary expression, what does the word "Ternary" indicate?

"Ternary" indicates three, and a ternary expression accepts three operands, the test condition, the "then" expression and the "else" expression. Ternary expressions are not specific to JavaScript and I'm not sure why it is even in this list.


#### Q. What is `"use strict";`? What are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?

'use strict' is a statement used to enable strict mode to entire scripts or individual functions. Strict mode is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript.

Advantages:

* Makes it impossible to accidentally create global variables.
* Makes assignments which would otherwise silently fail to throw an exception.
* Makes attempts to delete undeletable properties throw (where before the attempt would simply have no effect).
* Requires that function parameter names be unique.
* `this` is undefined in the global context.
* It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.
* It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.

Disadvantages:

* Many missing features that some developers might be used to.
* No more access to `function.caller` and `function.arguments`.
* Concatenation of scripts written in different strict modes might cause issues.

Overall, I think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, and I never had to rely on the features that strict mode blocks. I would recommend using strict mode.


#### Q. Create a for loop that iterates up to `100` while outputting **"fizz"** at multiples of `3`, **"buzz"** at multiples of `5` and **"fizzbuzz"** at multiples of `3` and `5`.

Check out this version of FizzBuzz by [Paul Irish](https://gist.github.com/jaysonrowe/1592432#gistcomment-790724).

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  let f = i % 3 == 0,
    b = i % 5 == 0;
  console.log(f ? (b ? 'FizzBuzz' : 'Fizz') : b ? 'Buzz' : i);
}
```

I would not advise you to write the above during interviews though. Just stick with the long but clear approach. For more wacky versions of FizzBuzz, check out the reference link below.


#### Q. Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch it?

Every script has access to the global scope, and if everyone uses the global namespace to define their variables, collisions will likely occur. Use the module pattern (IIFEs) to encapsulate your variables within a local namespace.



#### Q. Why would you use something like the `load` event? Does this event have disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives, and why would you use those?

The `load` event fires at the end of the document loading process. At this point, all of the objects in the document are in the DOM, and all the images, scripts, links and sub-frames have finished loading.

The DOM event `DOMContentLoaded` will fire after the DOM for the page has been constructed, but do not wait for other resources to finish loading. This is preferred in certain cases when you do not need the full page to be loaded before initializing.

TODO.


#### Q. Explain what a single page app is and how to make one SEO-friendly.

The below is taken from the awesome [Grab Front End Guide](https://github.com/grab/front-end-guide), which coincidentally, is written by me!

Web developers these days refer to the products they build as web apps, rather than websites. While there is no strict difference between the two terms, web apps tend to be highly interactive and dynamic, allowing the user to perform actions and receive a response to their action. Traditionally, the browser receives HTML from the server and renders it. When the user navigates to another URL, a full-page refresh is required and the server sends fresh new HTML to the new page. This is called server-side rendering.

However, in modern SPAs, client-side rendering is used instead. The browser loads the initial page from the server, along with the scripts (frameworks, libraries, app code) and stylesheets required for the whole app. When the user navigates to other pages, a page refresh is not triggered. The URL of the page is updated via the [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API). New data required for the new page, usually in JSON format, is retrieved by the browser via [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started) requests to the server. The SPA then dynamically updates the page with the data via JavaScript, which it has already downloaded in the initial page load. This model is similar to how native mobile apps work.

The benefits:

* The app feels more responsive and users do not see the flash between page navigations due to full-page refreshes.
* Fewer HTTP requests are made to the server, as the same assets do not have to be downloaded again for each page load.
* Clear separation of the concerns between the client and the server; you can easily build new clients for different platforms (e.g. mobile, chatbots, smart watches) without having to modify the server code. You can also modify the technology stack on the client and server independently, as long as the API contract is not broken.

The downsides:

* Heavier initial page load due to the loading of framework, app code, and assets required for multiple pages.
* There's an additional step to be done on your server which is to configure it to route all requests to a single entry point and allow client-side routing to take over from there.
* SPAs are reliant on JavaScript to render content, but not all search engines execute JavaScript during crawling, and they may see empty content on your page. This inadvertently hurts the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of your app. However, most of the time, when you are building apps, SEO is not the most important factor, as not all the content needs to be indexable by search engines. To overcome this, you can either server-side render your app or use services such as [Prerender](https://prerender.io/) to "render your javascript in a browser, save the static HTML, and return that to the crawlers".


#### Q. What is the extent of your experience with Promises and/or their polyfills?

Possess working knowledge of it. A promise is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future: either a resolved value or a reason that it's not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.

Some common polyfills are `$.deferred`, Q and Bluebird but not all of them comply with the specification. ES2015 supports Promises out of the box and polyfills are typically not needed these days.


#### Q. What are the pros and cons of using Promises instead of callbacks?

**Pros**

* Avoid callback hell which can be unreadable.
* Makes it easy to write sequential asynchronous code that is readable with `.then()`.
* Makes it easy to write parallel asynchronous code with `Promise.all()`.
* With promises, these scenarios which are present in callbacks-only coding, will not happen:
  * Call the callback too early
  * Call the callback too late (or never)
  * Call the callback too few or too many times
  * Fail to pass along any necessary environment/parameters
  * Swallow any errors/exceptions that may happen

**Cons**

* Slightly more complex code (debatable).
* In older browsers where ES2015 is not supported, you need to load a polyfill in order to use it.


#### Q. What are some of the advantages/disadvantages of writing JavaScript code in a language that compiles to JavaScript?

Some examples of languages that compile to JavaScript include CoffeeScript, Elm, ClojureScript, PureScript, and TypeScript.

Advantages:

* Fixes some of the longstanding problems in JavaScript and discourages JavaScript anti-patterns.
* Enables you to write shorter code, by providing some syntactic sugar on top of JavaScript, which I think ES5 lacks, but ES2015 is awesome.
* Static types are awesome (in the case of TypeScript) for large projects that need to be maintained over time.

Disadvantages:

* Require a build/compile process as browsers only run JavaScript and your code will need to be compiled into JavaScript before being served to browsers.
* Debugging can be a pain if your source maps do not map nicely to your pre-compiled source.
* Most developers are not familiar with these languages and will need to learn it. There's a ramp up cost involved for your team if you use it for your projects.
* Smaller community (depends on the language), which means resources, tutorials, libraries, and tooling would be harder to find.
* IDE/editor support might be lacking.
* These languages will always be behind the latest JavaScript standard.
* Developers should be cognizant of what their code is being compiled to — because that is what would actually be running, and that is what matters in the end.

Practically, ES2015 has vastly improved JavaScript and made it much nicer to write. I don't really see the need for CoffeeScript these days.


#### Q. What tools and techniques do you use for debugging JavaScript code?

* React and Redux
  * [React Devtools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools)
  * [Redux Devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools)
* Vue
  * [Vue Devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools)
* JavaScript
  * [Chrome Devtools](https://hackernoon.com/twelve-fancy-chrome-devtools-tips-dc1e39d10d9d)
  * `debugger` statement
  * Good old `console.log` debugging


#### Q. What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?

For objects:

* `for-in` loops - `for (var property in obj) { console.log(property); }`. However, this will also iterate through its inherited properties, and you will add an `obj.hasOwnProperty(property)` check before using it.
* `Object.keys()` - `Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.keys()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.
* `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` - `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable and non-enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.

For arrays:

* `for` loops - `for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`. The common pitfall here is that `var` is in the function scope and not the block scope and most of the time you would want block scoped iterator variable. ES2015 introduces `let` which has block scope and it is recommended to use that instead. So this becomes: `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`.
* `forEach` - `arr.forEach(function (el, index) { ... })`. This construct can be more convenient at times because you do not have to use the `index` if all you need is the array elements. There are also the `every` and `some` methods which will allow you to terminate the iteration early.
* `for-of` loops - `for (let elem of arr) { ... }`. ES6 introduces a new loop, the `for-of` loop, that allows you to loop over objects that conform to the [iterable protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol) such as `String`, `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, etc. It combines the advantages of the `for` loop and the `forEach()` method. The advantage of the `for` loop is that you can break from it, and the advantage of `forEach()` is that it is more concise than the `for` loop because you don't need a counter variable. With the `for-of` loop, you get both the ability to break from a loop and a more concise syntax.

Most of the time, I would prefer the `.forEach` method, but it really depends on what you are trying to do. Before ES6, we used `for` loops when we needed to prematurely terminate the loop using `break`. But now with ES6, we can do that with `for-of` loops. I would use `for` loops when I need even more flexibility, such as incrementing the iterator more than once per loop.

Also, when using the `for-of` loop, if you need to access both the index and value of each array element, you can do so with the ES6 Array `entries()` method and destructuring:

```
const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (let [index, elem] of arr.entries()) {
  console.log(index, ': ', elem);
}
```

#### Q. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects.

Immutability is a core principle in functional programming, and has lots to offer to object-oriented programs as well. A mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

#### Q. What is an example of an immutable object in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, some built-in types (numbers, strings) are immutable, but custom objects are generally mutable.

Some built-in immutable JavaScript objects are `Math`, `Date`.

Here are a few ways to add/simulate immutability on plain JavaScript objects.

**Object Constant Properties**

By combining `writable: false` and `configurable: false`, you can essentially create a constant (cannot be changed, redefined or deleted) as an object property, like:

```js
let myObject = {};
Object.defineProperty(myObject, 'number', {
  value: 42,
  writable: false,
  configurable: false,
});
console.log(myObject.number); // 42
myObject.number = 43;
console.log(myObject.number); // 42
```

**Prevent Extensions**

If you want to prevent an object from having new properties added to it, but otherwise leave the rest of the object's properties alone, call `Object.preventExtensions(...)`:

```
var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

Object.preventExtensions(myObject);

myObject.b = 3;
myObject.b; // undefined
```

In non-strict mode, the creation of `b` fails silently. In strict mode, it throws a `TypeError`.

**Seal**

`Object.seal()` creates a "sealed" object, which means it takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.preventExtensions()` on it, but also marks all its existing properties as `configurable: false`.

So, not only can you not add any more properties, but you also cannot reconfigure or delete any existing properties (though you can still modify their values).

**Freeze**

`Object.freeze()` creates a frozen object, which means it takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.seal()` on it, but it also marks all "data accessor" properties as writable:false, so that their values cannot be changed.

This approach is the highest level of immutability that you can attain for an object itself, as it prevents any changes to the object or to any of its direct properties (though, as mentioned above, the contents of any referenced other objects are unaffected).

```js
var immutable = Object.freeze({});
```

Freezing an object does not allow new properties to be added to an object and prevents from removing or altering the existing properties. `Object.freeze()` preserves the enumerability, configurability, writability and the prototype of the object. It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.


#### Q. How can you achieve immutability in your own code?

One way to achieve immutability is to use libraries like [immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), [mori](https://github.com/swannodette/mori) or [immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer).

The alternative is to use `const` declarations combined with the techniques mentioned above for creation. For "mutating" objects, use the spread operator, `Object.assign`, `Array.concat()`, etc., to create new objects instead of mutate the original object.

Examples:

```js
// Array Example
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...arr, 4]; // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Object Example
const human = Object.freeze({race: 'human'});
const john = { ...human, name: 'John' }; // {race: "human", name: "John"}
const alienJohn = { ...john, race: 'alien' }; // {race: "alien", name: "John"}
```


#### Q. Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions.

Synchronous functions are blocking while asynchronous functions are not. In synchronous functions, statements complete before the next statement is run. In this case, the program is evaluated exactly in order of the statements and execution of the program is paused if one of the statements take a very long time.

Asynchronous functions usually accept a callback as a parameter and execution continue on the next line immediately after the asynchronous function is invoked. The callback is only invoked when the asynchronous operation is complete and the call stack is empty. Heavy duty operations such as loading data from a web server or querying a database should be done asynchronously so that the main thread can continue executing other operations instead of blocking until that long operation to complete (in the case of browsers, the UI will freeze).



#### Q. What is event loop? What is the difference between call stack and task queue?

The event loop is a single-threaded loop that monitors the call stack and checks if there is any work to be done in the task queue. If the call stack is empty and there are callback functions in the task queue, a function is dequeued and pushed onto the call stack to be executed.

If you haven't already checked out Philip Robert's [talk on the Event Loop](https://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/philip-roberts-what-the-heck-is-the-event-loop-anyway.html), you should. It is one of the most viewed videos on JavaScript.


#### Q. Explain the differences on the usage of `foo` between `function foo() {}` and `var foo = function() {}`

The former is a function declaration while the latter is a function expression. The key difference is that function declarations have its body hoisted but the bodies of function expressions are not (they have the same hoisting behavior as variables). For more explanation on hoisting, refer to the question above [on hoisting](#explain-hoisting). If you try to invoke a function expression before it is defined, you will get an `Uncaught TypeError: XXX is not a function` error.

**Function Declaration**

```js
foo(); // 'FOOOOO'
function foo() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
}
```

**Function Expression**

```js
foo(); // Uncaught TypeError: foo is not a function
var foo = function() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
};
```


#### Q. What are the differences between variables created using `let`, `var` or `const`?

Variables declared using the `var` keyword are scoped to the function in which they are created, or if created outside of any function, to the global object. `let` and `const` are _block scoped_, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest set of curly braces (function, if-else block, or for-loop).

```js
function foo() {
  // All variables are accessible within functions.
  var bar = 'bar';
  let baz = 'baz';
  const qux = 'qux';

  console.log(bar); // bar
  console.log(baz); // baz
  console.log(qux); // qux
}

console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: bar is not defined
console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: baz is not defined
console.log(qux); // ReferenceError: qux is not defined
```

```js
if (true) {
  var bar = 'bar';
  let baz = 'baz';
  const qux = 'qux';
}

// var declared variables are accessible anywhere in the function scope.
console.log(bar); // bar
// let and const defined variables are not accessible outside of the block they were defined in.
console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: baz is not defined
console.log(qux); // ReferenceError: qux is not defined
```

`var` allows variables to be hoisted, meaning they can be referenced in code before they are declared. `let` and `const` will not allow this, instead throwing an error.

```js
console.log(foo); // undefined

var foo = 'foo';

console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'baz' before initialization

let baz = 'baz';

console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'bar' before initialization

const bar = 'bar';
```

Redeclaring a variable with `var` will not throw an error, but 'let' and 'const' will.

```js
var foo = 'foo';
var foo = 'bar';
console.log(foo); // "bar"

let baz = 'baz';
let baz = 'qux'; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'baz' has already been declared
```

`let` and `const` differ in that `let` allows reassigning the variable's value while `const` does not.

```js
// This is fine.
let foo = 'foo';
foo = 'bar';

// This causes an exception.
const baz = 'baz';
baz = 'qux';
```

#### Q. What are the differences between ES6 class and ES5 function constructors?

Let's first look at example of each:

```js
// ES5 Function Constructor
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// ES6 Class
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

For simple constructors, they look pretty similar.

The main difference in the constructor comes when using inheritance. If we want to create a `Student` class that subclasses `Person` and add a `studentId` field, this is what we have to do in addition to the above.

```js
// ES5 Function Constructor
function Student(name, studentId) {
  // Call constructor of superclass to initialize superclass-derived members.
  Person.call(this, name);

  // Initialize subclass's own members.
  this.studentId = studentId;
}

Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

// ES6 Class
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, studentId) {
    super(name);
    this.studentId = studentId;
  }
}
```

It's much more verbose to use inheritance in ES5 and the ES6 version is easier to understand and remember.


#### Q. Can you offer a use case for the new arrow => function syntax? How does this new syntax differ from other functions?

One obvious benefit of arrow functions is to simplify the syntax needed to create functions, without a need for the `function` keyword. The `this` within arrow functions is also bound to the enclosing scope which is different compared to regular functions where the `this` is determined by the object calling it. Lexically-scoped `this` is useful when invoking callbacks especially in React components.



#### Q. What advantage is there for using the arrow syntax for a method in a constructor?

The main advantage of using an arrow function as a method inside a constructor is that the value of `this` gets set at the time of the function creation and can't change after that. So, when the constructor is used to create a new object, `this` will always refer to that object. For example, let's say we have a `Person` constructor that takes a first name as an argument has two methods to `console.log` that name, one as a regular function and one as an arrow function:

```js
const Person = function(firstName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.sayName1 = function() { console.log(this.firstName); };
  this.sayName2 = () => { console.log(this.firstName); };
};

const john = new Person('John');
const dave = new Person('Dave');

john.sayName1(); // John
john.sayName2(); // John

// The regular function can have its 'this' value changed, but the arrow function cannot
john.sayName1.call(dave); // Dave (because "this" is now the dave object)
john.sayName2.call(dave); // John

john.sayName1.apply(dave); // Dave (because 'this' is now the dave object)
john.sayName2.apply(dave); // John

john.sayName1.bind(dave)(); // Dave (because 'this' is now the dave object)
john.sayName2.bind(dave)(); // John

var sayNameFromWindow1 = john.sayName1;
sayNameFromWindow1(); // undefined (because 'this' is now the window object)

var sayNameFromWindow2 = john.sayName2;
sayNameFromWindow2(); // John
```

The main takeaway here is that `this` can be changed for a normal function, but the context always stays the same for an arrow function. So even if you are passing around your arrow function to different parts of your application, you wouldn't have to worry about the context changing.

This can be particularly helpful in React class components. If you define a class method for something such as a click handler using a normal function, and then you pass that click handler down into a child component as a prop, you will need to also bind `this` in the constructor of the parent component. If you instead use an arrow function, there is no need to also bind "this", as the method will automatically get its "this" value from its enclosing lexical context. (See this article for an excellent demonstration and sample code: https://medium.com/@machnicki/handle-events-in-react-with-arrow-functions-ede88184bbb)


#### Q. What is the definition of a higher-order function?

A higher-order function is any function that takes one or more functions as arguments, which it uses to operate on some data, and/or returns a function as a result. Higher-order functions are meant to abstract some operation that is performed repeatedly. The classic example of this is `map`, which takes an array and a function as arguments. `map` then uses this function to transform each item in the array, returning a new array with the transformed data. Other popular examples in JavaScript are `forEach`, `filter`, and `reduce`. A higher-order function doesn't just need to be manipulating arrays as there are many use cases for returning a function from another function. `Function.prototype.bind` is one such example in JavaScript.

**Map**

Let say we have an array of names which we need to transform each string to uppercase.

```js
const names = ['irish', 'daisy', 'anna'];
```

The imperative way will be as such:

```js
const transformNamesToUppercase = function(names) {
  const results = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    results.push(names[i].toUpperCase());
  }
  return results;
};
transformNamesToUppercase(names); // ['IRISH', 'DAISY', 'ANNA']
```

Use `.map(transformerFn)` makes the code shorter and more declarative.

```js
const transformNamesToUppercase = function(names) {
  return names.map(name => name.toUpperCase());
};
transformNamesToUppercase(names); // ['IRISH', 'DAISY', 'ANNA']
```

#### Q. Can you give an example for destructuring an object or an array?

Destructuring is an expression available in ES6 which enables a succinct and convenient way to extract values of Objects or Arrays and place them into distinct variables.

**Array destructuring**

```js
// Variable assignment.
const foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

const [one, two, three] = foo;
console.log(one); // "one"
console.log(two); // "two"
console.log(three); // "three"
```

```js
// Swapping variables
let a = 1;
let b = 3;

[a, b] = [b, a];
console.log(a); // 3
console.log(b); // 1
```

**Object destructuring**

```js
// Variable assignment.
const o = { p: 42, q: true };
const { p, q } = o;

console.log(p); // 42
console.log(q); // true
```

#### Q. ES6 Template Literals offer a lot of flexibility in generating strings, can you give an example?

Template literals help make it simple to do string interpolation, or to include variables in a string. Before ES2015, it was common to do something like this:

```js
var person = { name: 'Tyler', age: 28 };
console.log('Hi, my name is ' + person.name + ' and I am ' + person.age + ' years old!');
// 'Hi, my name is Tyler and I am 28 years old!'
```

With template literals, you can now create that same output like this instead:

```js
const person = { name: 'Tyler', age: 28 };
console.log(`Hi, my name is ${person.name} and I am ${person.age} years old!`);
// 'Hi, my name is Tyler and I am 28 years old!'
```

Note that you use backticks, not quotes, to indicate that you are using a template literal and that you can insert expressions inside the `${}` placeholders.

A second helpful use case is in creating multi-line strings. Before ES2015, you could create a multi-line string like this:

```js
console.log('This is line one.\nThis is line two.');
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

Or if you wanted to break it up into multiple lines in your code so you didn't have to scroll to the right in your text editor to read a long string, you could also write it like this:

```js
console.log('This is line one.\n' +
	'This is line two.');
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

Template literals, however, preserve whatever spacing you add to them. For example, to create that same multi-line output that we created above, you can simply do:

```js
console.log(`This is line one.
This is line two.`);
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

Another use case of template literals would be to use as a substitute for templating libraries for simple variable interpolations:

```js
const person = { name: 'Tyler', age: 28 };
document.body.innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <p>Name: ${person.name}</p>
    <p>Name: ${person.age}</p>
  </div>
`
```

**Note that your code may be susceptible to XSS by using `.innerHTML`. Sanitize your data before displaying it if it came from a user!**


#### Q. Can you give an example of a curry function and why this syntax offers an advantage?

Currying is a pattern where a function with more than one parameter is broken into multiple functions that, when called in series, will accumulate all of the required parameters one at a time. This technique can be useful for making code written in a functional style easier to read and compose. It's important to note that for a function to be curried, it needs to start out as one function, then broken out into a sequence of functions that each accepts one parameter.

```js
function curry(fn) {
  if (fn.length === 0) {
    return fn;
  }

  function _curried(depth, args) {
    return function(newArgument) {
      if (depth - 1 === 0) {
        return fn(...args, newArgument);
      }
      return _curried(depth - 1, [...args, newArgument]);
    };
  }

  return _curried(fn.length, []);
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

var curriedAdd = curry(add);
var addFive = curriedAdd(5);

var result = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(addFive); // [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```


#### Q. What are the benefits of using spread syntax and how is it different from rest syntax?

ES6's spread syntax is very useful when coding in a functional paradigm as we can easily create copies of arrays or objects without resorting to `Object.create`, `slice`, or a library function. This language feature is used often in Redux and rx.js projects.

```js
function putDookieInAnyArray(arr) {
  return [...arr, 'dookie'];
}

const result = putDookieInAnyArray(['I', 'really', "don't", 'like']); // ["I", "really", "don't", "like", "dookie"]

const person = {
  name: 'Todd',
  age: 29,
};

const copyOfTodd = { ...person };
```

ES6's rest syntax offers a shorthand for including an arbitrary number of arguments to be passed to a function. It is like an inverse of the spread syntax, taking data and stuffing it into an array rather than unpacking an array of data, and it works in function arguments, as well as in array and object destructuring assignments.

```js
function addFiveToABunchOfNumbers(...numbers) {
  return numbers.map(x => x + 5);
}

const result = addFiveToABunchOfNumbers(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10); // [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

const [a, b, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // a: 1, b: 2, rest: [3, 4]

const { e, f, ...others } = {
  e: 1,
  f: 2,
  g: 3,
  h: 4,
}; // e: 1, f: 2, others: { g: 3, h: 4 }
```


#### Q. How can you share code between files?

This depends on the JavaScript environment.

On the client (browser environment), as long as the variables/functions are declared in the global scope (`window`), all scripts can refer to them. Alternatively, adopt the Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) via RequireJS for a more modular approach.

On the server (Node.js), the common way has been to use CommonJS. Each file is treated as a module and it can export variables and functions by attaching them to the `module.exports` object.

ES2015 defines a module syntax which aims to replace both AMD and CommonJS. This will eventually be supported in both browser and Node environments.


#### Q. Why you might want to create static class members?

Static class members (properties/methods) are not tied to a specific instance of a class and have the same value regardless of which instance is referring to it. Static properties are typically configuration variables and static methods are usually pure utility functions which do not depend on the state of the instance.

#### Q. What's the difference between `undefined` and `not defined` in JavaScript


In JavaScript if you try to use a variable that doesn't exist and has not been declared, then JavaScript will throw an error `var name is not defined` and the script will stop executing thereafter. But If you use `typeof undeclared_variable` then it will return `undefined`.

Before starting further discussion let's understand the difference between declaration and definition.

`var x` is a declaration because you are not defining what value it holds yet, but you are declaring its existence and the need for memory allocation.

```javascript
var x; // declaring x
console.log(x); // output: undefined
```

`var x = 1` is both declaration and definition (also we can say we are doing initialisation), Here declaration and assignment of value happen inline for variable x, In JavaScript every variable declaration and function declaration brings to the top of its current scope in which it's declared then assignment happen in order this term is called `hoisting`.

A variable can be declared but not defined. When we try to access it, It will result `undefined`.

```javascript
var x; // Declaration
typeof x === 'undefined'; // Will return true
```

A variable can be neither declared nor defined. When we try to reference such variable then the result will be `not defined`.

```javascript
console.log(y);  // Output: ReferenceError: y is not defined
```


#### Q. For which value of `x` the results of the following statements are not the same?


```javascript
//  if( x <= 100 ) {...}
if( !(x > 100) ) {...}
```


`NaN <= 100` is `false` and `NaN > 100` is also `false`, so if the
value of `x` is `NaN`, the statements are not the same.

The same holds true for any value of x that being converted to Number, returns NaN, e.g.: `undefined`, `[1,2,5]`, `{a:22}` , etc.

This is why you need to pay attention when you deal with numeric variables. `NaN` can’t be equal, less than or more than any other numeric value, so the only reliable way to check if the value is `NaN`, is to use `isNaN()` function.

#### Q. What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects?



One of the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects is that they are very memory inefficient.  When you do that, a new copy of the method is created for each instance of an object. Let's see it on example:

```javascript
var Employee = function (name, company, salary) {
  this.name = name || "";       
  this.company = company || "";
  this.salary = salary || 5000;

  // We can create a method like this:
  this.formatSalary = function () {
      return "$ " + this.salary;
  };
};

// we can also create method in Employee's prototype:
Employee.prototype.formatSalary2 = function() {
    return "$ " + this.salary;
}

//creating objects
var emp1 = new Employee('Yuri Garagin', 'Company 1', 1000000);
var emp2 = new Employee('Dinesh Gupta', 'Company 2', 1039999);
var emp3 = new Employee('Erich Fromm', 'Company 3', 1299483);
```

Here each instance variable `emp1`, `emp2`, `emp3` has own copy of `formatSalary` method. However the `formatSalary2` will only be added once to an object `Employee.prototype`.

#### Q. What is “closure” in javascript? Can you provide an example?



A closure is a function defined inside another function (called parent function) and has access to the variable which is declared and defined in parent function scope.

The closure has access to the variable in three scopes:
- Variable declared in his own scope
- Variable declared in parent function scope
- Variable declared in the global namespace

```javascript
var globalVar = "abc";

// Parent self invoking function
(function outerFunction (outerArg) { // begin of scope outerFunction
  // Variable declared in outerFunction function scope
  var outerFuncVar = 'x';    
  // Closure self-invoking function
  (function innerFunction (innerArg) { // begin of scope innerFunction
    // variable declared in innerFunction function scope
    var innerFuncVar = "y";
    console.log(         
      "outerArg = " + outerArg + "\n" +
      "outerFuncVar = " + outerFuncVar + "\n" +
      "innerArg = " + innerArg + "\n" +
      "innerFuncVar = " + innerFuncVar + "\n" +
      "globalVar = " + globalVar);
  // end of scope innerFunction
  })(5); // Pass 5 as parameter
// end of scope outerFunction
})(7); // Pass 7 as parameter
```

`innerFunction` is closure which is defined inside `outerFunction` and has access to all variable which is declared and defined in outerFunction scope. In addition to this function defined inside the function as closure has access to the variable which is declared in `global namespace`.

Output of above code would be:

```javascript
outerArg = 7
outerFuncVar = x
innerArg = 5
innerFuncVar = y
globalVar = abc
```

#### Q. Write a mul function which will work properly when invoked with following syntax.

```javascript
console.log(mul(2)(3)(4)); // output : 24
console.log(mul(4)(3)(4)); // output : 48
```


Below is the code followed by the explanation of how it works:

```javascript
function mul (x) {
  return function (y) { // anonymous function
    return function (z) { // anonymous function
      return x * y * z;
    };
  };
}
```

Here the `mul` function accepts the first argument and returns the anonymous function which takes the second parameter and returns the anonymous function which takes the third parameter and returns the multiplication of arguments which is being passed in successive

In Javascript function defined inside has access to outer function variable and function is the first class object so it can be returned by the function as well and passed as an argument in another function.
- A function is an instance of the Object type
- A function can have properties and has a link back to its constructor method
- A function can be stored as variable
- A function can be pass as a parameter to another function
- A function can be returned from another function

#### Q. How to empty an array in JavaScript?
For instance:

```javascript
var arrayList =  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'];
```

How can we empty the array above?



There are a couple of ways by which we can empty an array, So let's discuss all the possible way by which we can empty an array.

**Method 1**

```javascript
arrayList = [];
```

The code above will set the variable `arrayList` to a new empty array. This is recommended if you don't have **references to the original array** `arrayList` anywhere else because It will actually create a new empty array. You should be careful with this way of empty the array, because if you have referenced this array from another variable, then the original reference array will remain unchanged, Only use this way if you have only referenced the array by its original variable `arrayList`.

For instance:

```javascript
var arrayList = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']; // Created array
var anotherArrayList = arrayList;  // Referenced arrayList by another variable
arrayList = []; // Empty the array
console.log(anotherArrayList); // Output ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```

**Method 2**

```javascript
arrayList.length = 0;
```

The code above will clear the existing array by setting its length to 0. This way of emptying an array will also update all the reference variables that point to the original array. 

For instance:

```javascript
var arrayList = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']; // Created array
var anotherArrayList = arrayList;  // Referenced arrayList by another variable
arrayList.length = 0; // Empty the array by setting length to 0
console.log(anotherArrayList); // Output []
```

**Method 3**

```javascript
arrayList.splice(0, arrayList.length);
```

Above implementation will also work perfectly. This way of empty the array will also update all the references of the original array.

```javascript
var arrayList = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']; // Created array
var anotherArrayList = arrayList;  // Referenced arrayList by another variable
arrayList.splice(0, arrayList.length); // Empty the array by setting length to 0
console.log(anotherArrayList); // Output []
```

**Method 4**

```javascript
while(arrayList.length) {
  arrayList.pop();
}
```

Above implementation can also empty the array. But not recommended to use often.


#### Q. How to check if an object is an array or not?



The best way to find whether an object is instance of a particular class or not using `toString` method from `Object.prototype`

```javascript
var arrayList = [1 , 2, 3];
```

One of the best use cases of type checking of an object is when we do method overloading in JavaScript. To understand this, let's say we have a method called `greet` which can take a single string and also a list of strings. To make our `greet` method workable in both situation we need to know what kind of parameter is being passed: is it single value or list of values?

```javascript
function greet(param) {
  if() {
    // here have to check whether param is array or not
  }
  else {
  }
}
```

However, in the above implementation it might not necessary to check the type of the array, we can check for single value string and put array logic code in else block, let see below code for the same.

```javascript
 function greet(param) {
   if(typeof param === 'string') {
   }
   else {
     // If param is of type array then this block of code would execute
   }
 }
```

Now it's fine we can go with the previous two implementations, but when we have a situation like a parameter can be `single value`, `array`, and `object` type then we will be in trouble.

Coming back to checking the type of an object, As we mentioned that we can use `Object.prototype.toString`

```javascript
if(Object.prototype.toString.call(arrayList) === '[object Array]') {
  console.log('Array!');
}
```

If you are using `jQuery` then you can also used jQuery `isArray` method:

```javascript
if($.isArray(arrayList)) {
  console.log('Array');
} else {
  console.log('Not an array');
}
```

FYI jQuery uses `Object.prototype.toString.call` internally to check whether an object is an array or not.

In modern browser, you can also use:

```javascript
Array.isArray(arrayList);
```

`Array.isArray` is supported by Chrome 5, Firefox 4.0, IE 9, Opera 10.5 and Safari 5


#### Q. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var output = (function(x) {
  delete x;
  return x;
})(0);

console.log(output);
```


The code above will output `0` as output. `delete` operator is used to delete a property from an object. Here `x` is not an object it's **local variable**. `delete` operator doesn't affect local variables.


#### Q. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var x = 1;
var output = (function() {
  delete x;
  return x;
})();

console.log(output);
```


The code above will output `1` as output. `delete` operator is used to delete a property from an object. Here `x` is not an object it's **global variable** of type `number`.


#### Q. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var x = { foo : 1};
var output = (function() {
  delete x.foo;
  return x.foo;
})();

console.log(output);
```


The code above will output `undefined` as output. `delete` operator is used to delete a property from an object. Here `x` is an object which has foo as a property and from a self-invoking function, we are deleting the `foo` property of object `x` and after deletion, we are trying to reference deleted property `foo` which result `undefined`.


#### Q. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var Employee = {
  company: 'xyz'
}
var emp1 = Object.create(Employee);
delete emp1.company
console.log(emp1.company);
```


The code above will output `xyz` as output. Here `emp1` object got company as **prototype** property. delete operator doesn't delete prototype property.

`emp1` object doesn't have **company** as its own property. you can test it `console.log(emp1.hasOwnProperty('company')); //output : false` However, we can delete company property directly from `Employee` object using `delete Employee.company` or we can also delete from `emp1` object using `__proto__` property `delete emp1.__proto__.company`.


#### Q. What is `undefined x 1` in JavaScript

```javascript
var trees = ["redwood", "bay", "cedar", "oak", "maple"];
delete trees[3];
```

 - When you run the code above and do `console.log(trees);` in chrome developer console then you will get `["redwood", "bay", "cedar", undefined × 1, "maple"]`.
 - In the recent versions of Chrome you will see the word `empty` of `undefined x 1`.
 - When you run the same code in Firefox browser console then you will get `["redwood", "bay", "cedar", undefined, "maple"]`
  
Clearly we can see that Chrome has its own way of displaying uninitialized index in arrays. However when you check `trees[3] === undefined` in any browser you will get similar output as `true`.

**Note:** Please remember that you need not check for the uninitialized index of the array in  `trees[3] === 'undefined × 1'` it will give an error because `'undefined × 1'` this is just way of displaying an uninitialized index of an array in chrome.



#### Q. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var trees = ["xyz", "xxxx", "test", "ryan", "apple"];
delete trees[3];
console.log(trees.length);
```

The code above will output `5` as output. When we used `delete` operator for deleting an array element then, the array length is not affected by this. This holds even if you deleted all elements of an array using `delete` operator.

So when delete operator removes an array element that deleted element is no longer present in the array. In place of value at deleted index `undefined x 1` in **chrome** and `undefined` is placed at the index. If you do `console.log(trees)` output `["xyz", "xxxx", "test", undefined × 1, "apple"]` in Chrome and in Firefox `["xyz", "xxxx", "test", undefined, "apple"]`.



#### Q. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var bar = true;
console.log(bar + 0);   
console.log(bar + "xyz");  
console.log(bar + true);  
console.log(bar + false);
```

The code above will output `1, "truexyz", 2, 1` as output. Here's a general guideline  for the plus operator:
  - Number + Number  -> Addition
  - Boolean + Number -> Addition
  - Boolean + Boolean -> Addition
  - Number + String  -> Concatenation
  - String + Boolean -> Concatenation
  - String + String  -> Concatenation
  
  

#### Q. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var z = 1, y = z = typeof y;
console.log(y);
```

The code above will print string `"undefined"` as output. According to associativity rule operator with the same precedence are processed based on their associativity property of operator. Here associativity of the assignment operator is `Right to Left` so first `typeof y` will evaluate first which is string `"undefined"` and assigned to `z` and then `y` would be assigned the value of z. The overall sequence will look like that: 

```javascript
var z;
z = 1;
var y;
z = typeof y;
y = z;
```

#### Q. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
// NFE (Named Function Expression)
var foo = function bar() { return 12; };
typeof bar();
```


The output will be `Reference Error`. To fix the bug we can try to rewrite the code a little bit: 

**Sample 1**

```javascript
var bar = function() { return 12; };
typeof bar();
```

or

**Sample 2**

```javascript
function bar() { return 12; };
typeof bar();
```

The function definition can have only one reference variable as a function name, In **sample 1** `bar` is reference variable which is pointing to `anonymous function` and in **sample 2** we have function statement and `bar` is the function name.

```javascript
var foo = function bar() {
  // foo is visible here
  // bar is visible here
  console.log(typeof bar()); // Works here :)
};
// foo is visible here
// bar is undefined here
```

#### Q. What is the difference between declaring a function in the formats listed below?

```javascript
var foo = function() {
  // Some code
}
```

```javascript
function bar () {
  // Some code
}
```


The main difference is that function `foo` is defined at `run-time` and is called a function expression, whereas function `bar` is defined at `parse time` and is called a function statement. To understand it better, let's take a look at the code below :

```javascript
// Run-Time function declaration
  foo(); // Call foo function here, It will give an error
  var foo = function() {
    console.log("Hi I am inside Foo");
  };
```

```javascript
// Parse-Time function declaration
bar(); // Call bar function here, It will not give an Error
function bar() {
  console.log("Hi I am inside Foo");
}
```
#### Q. What is the output of the following?

```javascript
bar();
(function abc(){console.log('something')})();
function bar(){console.log('bar got called')};
```


The output will be :
``` 
bar got called
something
```
Since the function is called first and defined during parse time the JS engine will try to find any possible parse time definitions and start the execution loop which will mean function is called first even if the definition is post another function.

#### Q. In which case the function definition is not hoisted in JavaScript?

Let's take the following **function expression**

```javascript
 var foo = function foo() {
     return 12;
 }
```

In JavaScript `var`-declared variables and functions are `hoisted`. Let's take function `hoisting` first. Basically, the JavaScript interpreter looks ahead to find all the variable declaration and hoists them to the top of the function where it's declared. For example:

```javascript
foo(); // Here foo is still undefined
var foo = function foo() {
  return 12;
};
```

The code above behind the scene look something like this:

```javascript
var foo = undefined;
foo(); // Here foo is undefined
foo = function foo() {
  // Some code stuff
}
```

```javascript
var foo = undefined;
foo = function foo() {
  // Some code stuff
}
foo(); // Now foo is defined here
```

#### Q. What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
var salary = "1000$";

(function () {
  console.log("Original salary was " + salary);

  var salary = "5000$";

  console.log("My New Salary " + salary);
})();
```

The code above will output: `undefined, 5000$` because of hoisting. In the code presented above, you might be expecting `salary` to retain it values from outer scope until the point that `salary` was re-declared in the inner scope. But due to `hoisting` salary value was `undefined` instead. To understand it better have a look of the following code, here `salary` variable is hoisted and declared at the top in function scope. When we print its value using `console.log` the result is `undefined`. Afterwards the variable is redeclared and the new value `"5000$"` is assigned to it.

```javascript
var salary = "1000$";

(function () {
  var salary = undefined;
  console.log("Original salary was " + salary);

  salary = "5000$";

  console.log("My New Salary " + salary);
})();
```

#### Q. What’s the difference between `typeof` and `instanceof`?


`typeof` is an operator that returns a string with the type of whatever you pass.

The `typeof` operator checks if a value belongs to one of the seven basic types: `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `object`, `function`, `undefined` or `Symbol`.

`typeof(null)` will return `object`.

`instanceof` is much more intelligent: it works on the level of prototypes. In particular, it tests to see if the right operand appears anywhere in the prototype chain of the left. `instanceof` doesn’t work with primitive types. It `instanceof` operator checks the current object and returns true if the object is of the specified type, for example:

```javascript
var dog = new Animal();
dog instanceof Animal; // Output : true
```

Here `dog instanceof Animal` is true since `dog` inherits from `Animal.prototype`

```javascript
var name = new String("xyz");
name instanceof String; // Output : true
```


#### Q. Calculate the length of the associative array

```javascript
var counterArray = {
  A : 3,
  B : 4
};
counterArray["C"] = 1;
```

First of all, in case of JavaScript an associative array is the same as an object. Secondly, even though is no built-in function or property available to calculate the length/size an object, we can write such function ourselves.

**Method 1**

`Object` has `keys` method which can we used to calculate the length of object.

```javascript
Object.keys(counterArray).length; // Output 3
```

**Method 2**

We can also calculate the length of object by iterating through the object and by doing a count of own property of object. This way we will ignoge the properties that came from the object's prototype chain:  

```javascript
function getLength(object) {
  var count = 0;
  for(key in object) {
    // hasOwnProperty method check own property of object
    if(object.hasOwnProperty(key)) count++;
  }
  return count;
}
```

**Method 3**

All modern browsers (including IE9+) support the [`getOwnPropertyNames`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyNames) method, so we can calculate the length using the following code: 

```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(counterArray).length; // Output 3
```

**Method 4**

[Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/#size) and [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#size) libraries have the method `size` dedicated to calculate the object length. We don't recommend to include one of these libraries just to use the `size` method, but if it's already used in your project - why not? 

```javascript
_.size({one: 1, two: 2, three: 3});
=> 3
```

#### Q. Difference between `Function`, `Method` and `Constructor` calls in JavaScript.
If your are familiar with Object-oriented programming, More likely familiar to thinking of functions, methods, and class constructors as three separate things. But In JavaScript, these are just three different usage patterns of one single construct.

functions : The simplest usages of function call:

```javascript
function helloWorld(name) {
  return "hello world, " + name;
}

helloWorld("JS Geeks"); // "hello world JS Geeks"
```

Methods in JavaScript are nothing more than object properties that are functions.

```javascript
var obj = {
  helloWorld : function() {
    return "hello world, " + this.name;
  },
  name: 'John Carter'
}
obj.helloWorld(); // // "hello world John Carter"
```

Notice how `helloWorld` refer to `this` properties of obj. Here it's clear or you might have already understood that `this` gets bound to `obj`. But the interesting point that we can copy a reference to the same function `helloWorld` in another object and get a difference answer. Let see:

```javascript
var obj2 = {
  helloWorld : obj.helloWorld,
  name: 'John Doe'
}
obj2.helloWorld(); // "hello world John Doe"
```

You might be wonder what exactly happens in a method call here. Here we call the expression itself determine the binding of this `this`, The expression `obj2.helloWorld()` looks up the `helloWorld` property of obj and calls it with receiver object `obj2`.

The third use of functions is as constructors. Like function and method, `constructors` are defined with function.

```javascript
function Employee(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

var emp1 = new Employee('John Doe', 28);
emp1.name; // "John Doe"
emp1.age; // 28
```

Unlike function calls and method calls, a constructor call `new Employee('John Doe', 28)` creates a brand new object and passes it as the value of `this`, and implicitly returns the new object as its result.

The primary role of the constructor function is to initialize the object.


#### Q. What would be the output of the following code?

```javascript
function User(name) {
  this.name = name || "JsGeeks";
}

var person = new User("xyz")["location"] = "USA";
console.log(person);
```

The output of above code would be `"USA"`. Here `new User("xyz")` creates a brand new object and created property `location` on that and `USA` has been assigned to object property location and that has been referenced by the person.

Let say `new User("xyz")` created a object called `foo`. The value `"USA"` will be assigned to `foo["location"]`, but according to [ECMAScript Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-assignment-operators-runtime-semantics-evaluation) , pt 12.14.4 the assignment will itself return the rightmost value: in our case it's `"USA"`.
 Then it will be assigned to person. 
 
 To better understand what's going on here, try to execute this code in console, line by line:
 ```javascript
function User(name) {
  this.name = name || "JsGeeks";
}

var person;
var foo = new User("xyz");
foo["location"] = "USA";
// the console will show you that the result of this is "USA"

```

#### Q. What are Service Workers and when can you use them?

It’s a technology that allows your web application to use cached resources first, and provide default experience offline, before getting more data from the network later. This principle is commonly known as Offline First.

Service Workers actively use promises. A Service Worker has to be installed,activated and then it can react on fetch, push and sync events.

As of 2017, Service Workers are not supported in IE and Safari.

#### Q. What is the difference between a method and a function in javascript?
In JS, that difference is quite subtle. A function is a piece of code that is called by name and function itself not associated with any object and not defined inside any object. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. parameter) and can optionally return data (the return value).

```javascript
// Function statement
function myFunc() {
  // Do some stuff;
}

// Calling the function
myFunc();
```

Here myFunc() function call is not associated with object hence not invoked through any object.

A function can take a form of immediately invoked function expression (IIFE):

```javascript

// Anonymous Self-invoking Function
(function() {
  // Do some stuff;
})();
```

Finally there are also arrow functions: 

```javascript
const myFunc = arg => {
    console.log("hello", arg)
} 
```

A method is a piece of code that is called by its name and that is associated with the object. Methods are functions. When you call a method like this `obj1.myMethod()`, the reference to `obj1` gets assigned (bound) to `this` variable. In other words, the value of `this` will be `obj1` inside `myMethod`. 

Here are some examples of methods: 

**Example 1**

```javascript
var obj1 = {
  attribute: "xyz",
  myMethod: function () {  // Method
    console.log(this.attribute);
  }
};

// Call the method
obj1.myMethod();
```

Here `obj1` is an object and `myMethod` is a method which is associated with `obj1`.

**Example 2**

In ES6 we have classes. There the methods will look like this:

```javascript
class MyAwesomeClass {
  myMethod() {
    console.log("hi there");
  }
}

const obj1 = new MyAwesomeClass();
obj1.myMethod();
```

Understand: the method is not some kind of special type of a function, and it's not about how you declare a function. It's the way we **call** a function. Look at that: 

```javascript
var obj1 = {
  prop1: "buddy"
}; 
var myFunc = function () {
  console.log("Hi there", this);
};
// let's call myFunc as a function: 
myFunc(); // will output "Hi there undefined" or "Hi there Window"
 
obj1.myMethod = myFunc;
//now we're calling myFunc as a method of obj1, so this will point to obj1
obj1.myMethod(); // will print "Hi there" following with obj1. 

```

#### Q. What is IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) and how it can be useful?

IIFE a function that runs as soon as it's defined. Usually it's anonymous (doesn't have a function name), but it also can be named. Here's an example of IIFE:

```javascript
(function() {
  console.log("Hi, I'm IIFE!");
})();
// outputs "Hi, I'm IIFE!"
```

So, here's how it works. Remember the difference between function statements (`function a () {}`) and function expressions (`var a = function() {}`)? So, IIFE is a function expression. To make it an expression we surround our function declaration into the parens. We do it to explicitly tell the parser that it's an expression, not a statement (JS doesn't allow statements in parens).

After the function you can see the two `()` braces, this is how we run the function we just declared. 

That's it. The rest is details.  
- The function inside IIFE doesn't have to be anonymous. This one will work perfectly fine and will help to detect your function in a stacktrace during debugging: 
  ```javascript
  (function myIIFEFunc() {
    console.log("Hi, I'm IIFE!");
  })();
  // outputs "Hi, I'm IIFE!"
  ```
- It can take some parameters:
  ```javascript
  (function myIIFEFunc(param1) {
    console.log("Hi, I'm IIFE, " + param1);
  })("Yuri");
  // outputs "Hi, I'm IIFE, Yuri!"
  ```
  Here there value `"Yuri"` is passed to the `param1` of the function.
- It can return a value: 
  ```javascript
  var result = (function myIIFEFunc(param1) {
    console.log("Hi, I'm IIFE, " + param1);
    return 1;
  })("Yuri");
  // outputs "Hi, I'm IIFE, Yuri!"
  // result variable will contain 1
  ```
- You don't have to surround the function declaration into parens, although it's the most common way to define IIFE. Instead you can use any of the following forms: 
  - `~function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}()`
  - `!function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}()`
  - `+function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}()`
  - `-function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}()`
  - `(function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}());`
  - `var i = function(){console.log("hi I'm IIFE")}();`
  - `true && function(){ console.log("hi I'm IIFE") }();`
  - `0, function(){ console.log("hi I'm IIFE") }();`
  - `new function(){ console.log("hi I'm IIFE") }`
  - `new function(){ console.log("hi I'm IIFE") }()`
  
  Please don't use all these forms to impress colleagues, but be prepared that you can encounter them in someone's code. 

#### Q. Applications and usefulness

Variables and functions that you declare inside an IIFE are not visible to the outside world, so you can:
 - Use the IIFE for isolating parts of the code to hide details of implementation.
 - Specify the input interface of your code by passing commonly used global objects (window, document, jQuery, etc.) IIFE’s parameters, and then reference these global objects within the IIFE via a local scope.
 - Use it in closures, when you use closures in loops.
 - IIFE is the basis of in the module pattern in ES5
code, it helps to prevent polluting the global scope and provide the module interface to the outside.


#### Q. Describe Singleton Pattern In JavaScript 

The singleton pattern is an often used JavaScript design pattern. It provides a way to wrap the code into a logical unit that can be accessed through a single variable. The Singleton design pattern is used when only one instance of an object is needed throughout the lifetime of an application. In JavaScript, Singleton pattern have many uses, they can be used for NameSpacing, which reduce the number of global variables in your page (prevent from polluting global space), organizing the code in a consistent manner, which increase the readability and maintainability of your pages.

There are two important points in the traditional definition of Singleton pattern:
- There should be only one instance allowed for a class and
- We should allow global point of access to that single instance

Let me define singleton pattern in JavaScript context:

> It is an object that is used to create namespace and group together a related set of methods and attributes (encapsulation) and if we allow to initiate then it can be initiated only once.

In JavaScript, we can create singleton though object literal. However, there is some another way but that I will cover in next post.

A singleton object consists of two parts: The object itself, containing the members (Both methods and attributes) within it, and global variable used to access it. The variable is global so that object can be accessed anywhere in the page, this is a key feature of the singleton pattern.

**JavaScript: A Singleton as a Namespace**

As I have already stated above that singleton can be used to declare Namespace in JavaScript. NameSpacing is a large part of responsible programming in JavaScript. Because everything can be overwritten, and it is very easy to wipe out variable by mistake or a function, or even a class without even knowing it. A common example which happens frequently when you are working with another team member parallel,  

```javascript
function findUserName(id) {

}

/* Later in the page another programmer
added code */
var findUserName = $('#user_list');

/* You are trying to call :( */
console.log(findUserName())
```

One of the best ways to prevent accidentally overwriting variable is to namespace your code within a singleton object.

```javascript
/*  Using Namespace */

var MyNameSpace = {
  findUserName : function(id) {},
  // Other methods and attribute go here as well
}

/* Later in the page another programmer
added code */
var findUserName = $('#user_list');

/* You are trying to call and you make this time workable */
console.log(MyNameSpace.findUserName());
```

#### Q. Singleton Design Pattern Implementation

```javascript
/* Lazy Instantiation skeleton for a singleton pattern */

var MyNameSpace = {};
MyNameSpace.Singleton = (function() {

  // Private attribute that holds the single instance
  var singletonInstance;  

  // All of the normal code goes here
  function constructor() {
    // Private members
    var privateVar1 = "Nishant";
    var privateVar2 = [1,2,3,4,5];

    function privateMethod1() {
      // code stuff
    }

    function privateMethod1() {
      // code stuff
    }

    return {
      attribute1 : "Nishant",
      publicMethod: function() {
        alert("Nishant");// some code logic
      }
    }
  }

  return {
    // public method (Global access point to Singleton object)
    getInstance: function() {
      //instance already exist then return  
      if(!singletonInstance) {
        singletonInstance = constructor();
      }
      return singletonInstance;           
    }           
  }

})();   

// getting access of publicMethod
console.log(MyNamespace.Singleton.getInstance().publicMethod());
```

The singleton implemented above is easy to understand. The singleton class maintains a static reference to the lone singleton instance and return that reference from the static getInstance() method.

#### Q. What are the ways of creating objects in JavaScript ?


**Function based**

This method is useful if we want to create several similar objects. In the code sample below, we wrote the function `Employee` and used it as a constructor by calling it with the `new` operator. 

```javascript

  function Employee(fName, lName, age, salary){
  	this.firstName = fName;
  	this.lastName = lName;
  	this.age = age;
  	this.salary = salary;
  }

  // Creating multiple object which have similar property but diff value assigned to object property.
  var employee1 = new Employee('John', 'Moto', 24, '5000$');
  var employee1 = new Employee('Ryan', 'Jor', 26, '3000$');
  var employee1 = new Employee('Andre', 'Salt', 26, '4000$');
```

**Object Literal**

Object Literal is best way to create an object and this is used frequently. Below is code sample for create employee object which contains property as well as method.

```javascript
var employee = {
	name : 'Nishant',
	salary : 245678,
	getName : function(){
		return this.name;
	}
}
```
The code sample below is Nested Object Literal, Here address is an object inside employee object.

```javascript
var employee = {
	name : 'Nishant',
	salary : 245678,
	address : {
		addressLine1 : 'BITS Pilani',
		addressLine2 : 'Vidya Vihar'.
		phoneNumber: {
		  workPhone: 7098889765,
		  homePhone: 1234567898
		}
	}
}
```
**From `Object` using `new` keyword**

In the code below, a sample object has been created using `Object`'s constructor function.

```javascript
var employee = new Object(); // Created employee object using new keywords and Object()
employee.name = 'Nishant';
employee.getName = function(){
	return this.name;
}
```

**Using `Object.create`**

`Object.create(obj)` will create a new object and set the `obj` as its prototype. It’s a modern way to create objects that inherit properties from other objects. `Object.create` function doesn’t run the constructor. You can use `Object.create(null)` when you don’t want your object to inherit the properties of `Object`.

#### Q. Write a function called deepClone which takes an object and creates a object copy of it.

``` javascript
var newObject = deepClone(obj);
```
Solution:

```javascript
function deepClone(object){
	var newObject = {};
	for(var key in object){
		if(typeof object[key] === 'object'  && object[key] !== null ){
		 newObject[key] = deepClone(object[key]);
		}else{
		 newObject[key] = object[key];
		}
	}
	return newObject;
}
```

**Explanation:** We have been asked to do deep copy of object so What's basically it's mean ??. Let's understand in this way you have been given an object `personalDetail` this object contains some property which again a type of object here as you can see `address` is an object and `phoneNumber` in side an `address` is also an object. In simple term `personalDetail` is nested object(object inside object). So Here deep copy means we have to copy all the property of `personalDetail` object including nested object.

```javascript
var personalDetail = {
	name : 'Nishant',
	address : {
	  location: 'xyz',
	  zip : '123456',
	  phoneNumber : {
	    homePhone: 8797912345,
	    workPhone : 1234509876
	  }
	}
}
```
So when we do deep clone then we should copy every property (including the nested object).

#### Q. Best way to detect `undefined` object property in JavaScript.

> Suppose we have given an object `person`

```javascript
var person = {
	name: 'Nishant',
	age : 24
}
```
Here the `person` object has a `name` and `age` property. Now we are trying to access the **salary** property which we haven't declared on the person object so while accessing it will return undefined. So how we will ensure whether property is undefined or not before performing some operation over it?

**Explanation:**

We can use `typeof` operator to check undefined

```javascript
if(typeof someProperty === 'undefined'){
	console.log('something is undefined here');
}
```
Now we are trying to access salary property of person object.

```javascript
if(typeof person.salary === 'undefined'){
	console.log("salary is undefined here because we haven't declared");
}
```
#### Q. Write a function called `Clone` which takes an object and creates a object copy of it but not copy deep property of object. 

```javascript
   var objectLit = {foo : 'Bar'}; 
	var cloneObj = Clone(obj); // Clone is the function which you have to write 
	console.log(cloneObj === Clone(objectLit)); // this should return false
	console.log(cloneObj == Clone(objectLit)); // this should return true
```
**solution:** 

```javascript
function Clone(object){
  var newObject = {};
  for(var key in object){
  	newObject[key] = object[key];
  }
  return newObject;
}
```

#### Q. What are promises and how they are useful?

We use promises for handling asynchronous interactions in a sequential manner. They are especially useful when we need to do an async operation and THEN do another async operation based on the results of the first one. For example, if you want to request the list of all flights and then for each flight you want to request some details about it. The promise represents the future value. It has an internal state (`pending`, `fulfilled` and `rejected`) and works like a state machine.

A promise object has `then` method, where you can specify what to do when the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

You can chain `then()` blocks, thus avoiding the callback hell. You can handle errors in the `catch()` block.  After a promise is set to fulfilled or rejected state, it becomes immutable.

Also mention that you know about more sophisticated concepts: 
 - `async/await` which makes the code appear even more linear
 - RxJS observables can be viewed as the recyclable promises

Be sure that you can implement the promise, read [one of the articles on a topic](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2014/02/16/a-simple-promise-implementation-in-about-20-lines-of-javascript/), and learn the source code of the [simplest promise implementation](https://gist.github.com/softwaredoug/9044640). 


#### Q. How to check whether a key exist in a JavaScript object or not.

Let say we have `person` object with property **name** and **age**

```javascript
var person = {
	name: 'Nishant',
	age: 24
}
```
Now we want to check whether `name` property exist in `person` object or not ?

In JavaScript object can have own property, in above example name and age is own property of person object. Object also have some of inherited property of base object like toString is inherited property of person object.

So how we will check whether property is own property or inherited property. 

Method 1: We can use `in` operator on objet to check own property or inherited property. 

```javascript
console.log('name' in person); // checking own property print true 
console.log('salary' in person); // checking undefined property print false
```
`in` operator also look into inherited property if it doesn't find property defined as own property. For instance If I check existence of toString property as we know that we haven't declared this property on person object so `in` operator look into there base property.

Here 

```javascript
console.log('toString' in person); // Will print true
```
If we want to test property of object instance not inherited properties then we will use `hasOwnProperty` method of object instance.

```javascript
console.log(person.hasOwnProperty('toString')); // print false
console.log(person.hasOwnProperty('name')); // print true
console.log(person.hasOwnProperty('salary')); // print false
```

#### Q. What is NaN, why do we need it, and when can it break the page?
`NaN` stands for “not a number.” and it can break your table of numbers when it has an arithmetic operation that is not allowed. Here are some examples of how you can get `NaN`:

```javascript
Math.sqrt(-5);
Math.log(-1);
parseFloat("foo"); /* this is common: you get JSON from the server, convert some strings from JSON to a number and end up with NaN in your UI. */
```

`NaN` is not equal to any number, it’s not less or more than any number, also it's not equal to itself: 

```javascript
NaN !== NaN
NaN < 2 // false
NaN > 2 // false
NaN === 2 // false
```

To check if the current value of the variable is NaN, you have to use the `isNaN` function. This is why we can often see NaN in the webpages: it requires special check which a lot of developers forget to do.

#### Q. Fix the bug using ES5 only

```javascript
var arr = [10, 32, 65, 2];
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('The index of this number is: ' + i);
  }, 3000);
}
```
For ES6, you can just replace `var i` with `let i`. 

For ES5, you need to create a function scope like here:

```javascript 
var arr = [10, 32, 65, 2];
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  setTimeout(function(j) {
    return function () {
      console.log('The index of this number is: ' + j)
    };
  }(i), 3000);
}
```



#### Q. How to check if the value of a variable in an array?

We always encounter in such situation where we need to know whether value is type of array or not.

For instance : the code below perform some operation based value type

```javascript
function(value){
	if("value is an array"){
		// Then perform some operation
	}else{
		// otherwise
	}
}
```

Let's discuss some way to detect an array in JavaScript.

**Method 1:**

Juriy Zaytsev (Also known as kangax) proposed an elegant solution to this.

```javascript
	function isArray(value){
		return Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Array]';
	}
```
This approach is most popular way to detecting a value of type array in JavaScript and recommended to use. This approach relies on the fact that, native toString() method on a given value produce a standard string in all browser. 


**Method 2:** 

Duck typing test for array type detection

```javascript
 // Duck typing arrays
 function isArray(value){
 	return typeof value.sort === 'function';
 }
```
As we can see above isArray method will return true if value object have `sort` method of type `function`. Now assume you have created a object with sort method

```javascript
	var bar = {
		sort: function(){
			// Some code 
		}
	}
```
Now when you check `isArray(bar)` then it will return true because bar object has sort method, But the fact is bar is not an array.

So this method is not a best way to detect an array as you can see it's not handle the case when some object has sort method.

**Method 3:** 

ECMAScript 5 has introduced **Array.isArray()** method to detect an array type value. The sole purpose of this method is accurately detecting whether a value is an array or not.

In many JavaScript libraries you may see the code below for detecting an value of type array.

```javascript
function(value){
   // ECMAScript 5 feature
	if(typeof Array.isArray === 'function'){
		return Array.isArray(value);
	}else{
	   return Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Array]';
	}
}
```

#### Q. Best way to detect reference values of any type in JavaScript?

 In Javascript Object are called as reference type, Any value other then primitive is definitely a reference type. There are several built-in reference type such as **Object**, **Array**, **Function**, **Date**, **null** and **Error**.

Detecting object using `typeof` operator

```javascript
console.log(typeof {});           // object
console.log(typeof []);           // object
console.log(typeof new Array());  // object
console.log(typeof null);         // object 
console.log(typeof new RegExp()); // object
console.log(typeof new Date());   // object
```
But the downside of using typeof operator to detect an object is that typeof returns `object` for `null` (However this is fact that null is an object in JavaScript).

The best way to detect an object of specific reference type using `instanceof` operator.

>Syntax : **value** instanceof **constructor**   

```javascript
//Detecting an array
if(value instanceof Array){
	console.log("value is type of array");
}
```
```javascript
// Employee constructor function
function Employee(name){
	this.name = name; // Public property
}

var emp1 = new Employee('John');

console.log(emp1 instanceof Employee); // true
```
`instanceof` not only check the constructor which is used to create an object but also check it's prototype chain see below example.

```javascript
console.log(emp1 instanceof Object); // true
```

#### Q. How does Object.create method works JavaScript?

The ECMAScript 5 **Object.create()** method is the easiest way for one object to inherit from another, without invoking a constructor function. 

**For instance:** 

```javascript
var employee = {
  name: 'Nishant',
  displayName: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

var emp1 = Object.create(employee);
console.log(emp1.displayName());  // output "Nishant"
```

In the example above, we create a new object `emp1` that inherits from `employee`. In other words `emp1`'s prototype is set to `employee`. After this emp1 is able to access the same properties and method on employee until new properties or method with the same name are defined.

**For instance:** Defining `displayName()` method on `emp1` will not automatically override the employee `displayName`.

```javascript
emp1.displayName = function() {
	console.log('xyz-Anonymous');
};

employee.displayName(); //Nishant
emp1.displayName();//xyz-Anonymous
``` 

In addition to this **`Object.create(`)** method also allows to specify a second argument which is an object containing additional properties and methods to add to the new object.

**For example**

```javascript
var emp1 = Object.create(employee, {
	name: {
		value: "John"
	}
});

emp1.displayName(); // "John"
employee.displayName(); // "Nishant"
```
In the example above, `emp1` is created with it's own value for name, so calling **displayName()** method will display `"John"` instead of `"Nishant"`.

Object created in this manner give you full control over newly created object. You are free to add, remove any properties and method you want.

#### Q. How to use constructor functions for inheritance in JavaScript?

Let say we have `Person` class which has name, age, salary properties and **incrementSalary()** method.

```javascript
function Person(name, age, salary) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.salary = salary;
  this.incrementSalary = function (byValue) {
    this.salary = this.salary + byValue;
  };
}
```

Now we wish to create Employee class which contains all the properties of Person class and wanted to add some additional properties into Employee class.

```javascript
function Employee(company){
	this.company = company;
}

//Prototypal Inheritance 
Employee.prototype = new Person("Nishant", 24,5000);
```
In the example above, **Employee** type inherits from **Person**. It does so by assigning a new instance of `Person` to `Employee` prototype. After that, every instance of `Employee` inherits its properties and methods from `Person`.

```javascript
//Prototypal Inheritance 
Employee.prototype = new Person("Nishant", 24,5000);

var emp1 = new Employee("Google");

console.log(emp1 instanceof Person); // true
console.log(emp1 instanceof Employee); // true
```

Let's understand Constructor inheritance 

```javascript
//Defined Person class
function Person(name){
	this.name = name || "Nishant";
}

var obj = {};

// obj inherit Person class properties and method 
Person.call(obj); // constructor inheritance

console.log(obj); // Object {name: "Nishant"}
```
Here we saw calling **Person.call(obj)** define the name properties from `Person` to `obj`.

```javascript
console.log(name in obj); // true
```
Type-based inheritance is best used with developer defined constructor function rather than natively in JavaScript. In addition to this also allows flexibility in how we create similar type of object.

#### Q. How we can prevent modification of object in JavaScript ?.

 ECMAScript 5 introduce several methods to prevent modification of object which lock down object to ensure that no one, accidentally or otherwise, change functionality of Object.

There are three levels of preventing modification: 

**1: Prevent extensions :** 

No new properties or methods can be added to the object, but one can change the existing properties and method.

For example: 

```javascript
var employee = {
	name: "Nishant"
};

// lock the object 
Object.preventExtensions(employee);

// Now try to change the employee object property name
employee.name = "John"; // work fine 

//Now try to add some new property to the object
employee.age = 24; // fails silently unless it's inside the strict mode
```
**2: Seal :**

It is same as prevent extension, in addition to this also prevent existing properties and methods from being deleted.

To seal an object, we use **Object.seal()** method. you can check whether an object is sealed or not using **Object.isSealed();**

```javascript
var employee = {
	name: "Nishant"
};

// Seal the object 
Object.seal(employee);

console.log(Object.isExtensible(employee)); // false
console.log(Object.isSealed(employee)); // true

delete employee.name // fails silently unless it's in strict mode

// Trying to add new property will give an error
employee.age = 30; // fails silently unless in strict mode
``` 

when an object is sealed, its existing properties and methods can't be removed. Sealed object are also non-extensible.

**3: Freeze :**

Same as seal, In addition to this prevent existing properties methods from being modified (All properties and methods are read only).

To freeze an object, use Object.freeze() method. We can also determine whether an object is frozen using Object.isFrozen();

```javascript
var employee = {
	name: "Nishant"
};

//Freeze the object
Object.freeze(employee); 

// Seal the object 
Object.seal(employee);

console.log(Object.isExtensible(employee)); // false
console.log(Object.isSealed(employee));     // true
console.log(Object.isFrozen(employee));     // true


employee.name = "xyz"; // fails silently unless in strict mode
employee.age = 30;     // fails silently unless in strict mode
delete employee.name   // fails silently unless it's in strict mode
``` 

Frozen objects are considered both non-extensible and sealed.

**Recommended:**

If you are decided to prevent modification, sealed, freeze the object then use in strict mode so that you can catch the error.

For example: 

```javascript
"use strict";

var employee = {
	name: "Nishant"
};

//Freeze the object
Object.freeze(employee); 

// Seal the object 
Object.seal(employee);

console.log(Object.isExtensible(employee)); // false
console.log(Object.isSealed(employee));     // true
console.log(Object.isFrozen(employee));     // true


employee.name = "xyz"; // fails silently unless in strict mode
employee.age = 30;     // fails silently unless in strict mode
delete employee.name;  // fails silently unless it's in strict mode
``` 


#### Q. Write a log function which will add prefix `(your message)` to every message you log using console.log ? 
 For example, If you log `console.log("Some message")` then output should be **(your message) Some message**

Logging error message or some informative message is always required when you dealing with client side JavaScript using console.log method. Some time you want to add some prefix to identify message generated log from your application hence you would like to prefix your app name in every console.log. 

A general way to do this keep adding your app name in every console.log message like 

```javascript
console.log('your app name' + 'some error message');
```
But doing in this way you have to write your app name everytime when you log message using console.

There are some best way we can achieve this 

```javascript
function appLog() {
  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
  args.unshift('your app name');
  console.log.apply(console, args);
}

appLog("Some error message"); 
//output of above console: 'your app name Some error message'
```

#### Q. Write a function which will test string as a literal and as an object ?

For example: We can create string using string literal and using String constructor function. 

```javascript
 // using string literal
 var ltrlStr = "Hi I am string literal";
 // using String constructor function 
 var objStr = new String("Hi I am string object");
```
 We can use typeof operator to test string literal and instanceof operator to test String object.

```javascript
 function isString(str) {
 	return typeof(str) == 'string' || str instanceof String;
 }
 
 var ltrlStr = "Hi I am string literal";
 var objStr = new String("Hi I am string object");
 console.log(isString(ltrlStr)); // true
 console.log(isString(objStr)); // true
``` 
#### Q. What is typical use case for anonymous function in JavaScript ?

 Anonymous functions basically used in following scenario.

1. No name is needed if function is only used in one place, then there is no need to add a name to function.

	Let's take the example of setTimeout function 
	
	```javascript
	setTimeout(function(){
		alert("Hello");
	},1000);
	```
	Here there is no need of using named function when we are sure 	that function which will alert `hello` would use only once in 	application.

2. Anonymous functions are declared inline and inline functions have advantages in the case that they can access variable in the parent scopes.

	Let's take a example of event handler. Notify event of particular 	type (such as click) for a given object. 
	
	Let say we have HTML element (button) on which we want to add click event and when user do click on button we would like to execute some logic.
	
	```html
	<button id="myBtn"></button>
	```
	Add Event Listener 
	
	```javascript
	var btn = document.getElementById('myBtn');
	btn.addEventListener('click', function () {
	  alert('button clicked');
	});
	```
	
	Above example shows used of anonymous function as a callback function in event handler.
	
3. Passing anonymous function as a parameter to calling function.
	
	Example: 
	
	```javascript
	// Function which will execute callback function
	function processCallback(callback){
		if(typeof callback === 'function'){
			callback();
		}
	}
	
	// Call function and pass anonymous function as callback 
	processCallback(function(){
		alert("Hi I am anonymous callback function");
	});
	```
The best way to make a decision for using anonymous function is to ask the following question:

 Will the function which I am going to define, be used anywhere else?

If your answer is yes then go and create named function rather anonymous function.

**Advantage of using anonymous function:**

1. It can reduce a bit of code, particularly in recursive function and in callback function.
2.  Avoid needless global namespace pollutions.

#### Q. How to set a default parameter value ?

 If you are coming from python/c# you might be using default value for function parameter incase value(formal parameter) has not been passed. For instance : 

```python
// Define sentEmail function 
// configuration : Configuration object
// provider : Email Service provider, Default would be gmail
def sentEmail(configuration, provider = 'Gmail'):
	# Your code logic
```
**In Pre ES6/ES2015**

There are a lot of ways by which you can achieve this in pre ES2015.

Let's understand the code below by which we achieved setting default parameter value.

**Method 1: Setting default parameter value** 

```javascript
function sentEmail(configuration, provider) {
  // Set default value if user has not passed value for provider
  provider = typeof provider !== 'undefined' ? provider : 'Gmail'  
  // Your code logic
;
}
// In this call we are not passing provider parameter value
sentEmail({
  from: 'xyz@gmail.com',
  subject: 'Test Email'
});
// Here we are passing Yahoo Mail as a provider value
sentEmail({
  from: 'xyz@gmail.com',
  subject: 'Test Email'
}, 'Yahoo Mail');
```

**Method 2: Setting default parameter value** 

```javascript
function sentEmail(configuration, provider) {
  // Set default value if user has not passed value for provider
  provider = provider || 'Gmail'  
  // Your code logic
;
}
// In this call we are not passing provider parameter value
sentEmail({
  from: 'xyz@gmail.com',
  subject: 'Test Email'
});
// Here we are passing Yahoo Mail as a provider value

#### Q. Write code for merge two JavaScript Object dynamically.
Let say you have two objects 

```javascript
var person = {
	name : 'John',
	age  : 24
}

var address = {
	addressLine1 : 'Some Location x',
	addressLine2 : 'Some Location y',
	city : 'NewYork'
} 
```
Write merge function which will take two object and add all the own property of second object into first object.

```javascript
merge(person , address); 
 
/* Now person should have 5 properties 
name , age , addressLine1 , addressLine2 , city */
```
**Method 1: Using ES6, Object.assign method**

```javascript
const merge = (toObj, fromObj) => Object.assign(toObj, fromObj);
```
 
**Method 2: Without using built-in function**

```javascript
function merge(toObj, fromObj) {
  // Make sure both of the parameter is an object
  if (typeof toObj === 'object' && typeof fromObj === 'object') {
    for (var pro in fromObj) {
      // Assign only own properties not inherited properties
      if (fromObj.hasOwnProperty(pro)) {
        // Assign property and value
        toObj[pro] = fromObj[pro];
      }
    }
  }else{
  	throw "Merge function can apply only on object";
  }
}
```
#### Q. What is non-enumerable property in JavaScript and how you can create one?

Object can have properties that don't show up when you iterate through object using for...in loop or using Object.keys() to get an array of property names. This properties is know as non-enumerable properties.

Let say we have following object

```javascript
var person = {
	name: 'John'
};
person.salary = '10000$';
person['country'] = 'USA';

console.log(Object.keys(person)); // ['name', 'salary', 'country']
```
As we know that person object properties `name`, `salary` ,`country` are enumerable hence it's shown up when we called Object.keys(person).

To create a non-enumerable property we have to use **Object.defineProperty()**. This is a special method for creating non-enumerable property in JavaScript.

```javascript
var person = {
	name: 'John'
};
person.salary = '10000$';
person['country'] = 'USA';

// Create non-enumerable property
Object.defineProperty(person, 'phoneNo',{
	value : '8888888888',
	enumerable: false
})

Object.keys(person); // ['name', 'salary', 'country']
```
In the example above `phoneNo` property didn't show up because we made it non-enumerable by setting **enumerable:false**

Now let's try to change value of `phoneNo`

```javascript
person.phoneNo = '7777777777'; 
```
Changing non-enumerable property value will return error in `strict mode`. In non-strict mode it won't through any error but it won't change the value of phoneNo.

**Bonus**

**Object.defineProperty()** is also let you create read-only properties as we saw above, we are not able to modify phoneNo value of a person object.

#### Q. What is Function binding ?

 Function binding falls in advance JavaScript category and this is very popular technique to use in conjunction with event handler and callback function to preserve code execution context while passing function as a parameter.

Let's consider the following example:

```javascript
var clickHandler = {
	message: 'click event handler',
	handleClick: function(event) {
		console.log(this.message);
	}
};

var btn = document.getElementById('myBtn');
// Add click event to btn
btn.addEventListener('click', clickHandler.handleClick);
```

Here in this example clickHandler object is created which contain message properties and handleClick method.

We have assigned handleClick method to a DOM button, which will be executed in response of click. When the button is clicked, then handleClick method is being called and console message. Here console.log should log the `click event handler` message but it actually log `undefined`.

The problem of displaying `undefined` is because of the execution context of clickHandler.handleClick method is not being saved hence `this` pointing to button `btn` object. We can fix this issue using bind method.

```javascript
var clickHandler = {
	message: 'click event handler',
	handleClick: function(event) {
		console.log(this.message);
	}
};

var btn = document.getElementById('myBtn');
// Add click event to btn and bind the clickHandler object
btn.addEventListener('click', clickHandler.handleClick.bind(clickHandler));
```

`bind` method is available to all the function similar to call and apply method which take argument value of `this`.


## Passing values by reference vs by value
For a JS developer, it's crucially important to understand which values are passed by reference,
and which ones are passed by value. Remember that objects, including arrays are passed by reference
while strings, booleans and numbers are passed by value. 

#### Q. What would be the output of following code?

```javascript
var strA = "hi there";
var strB = strA;
strB="bye there!";
console.log (strA)
```

The output will `'hi there'` because we're dealing with strings here. Strings are 
passed by value, that is, copied. 
 
#### Q. What would be the output of following code?
```javascript
var objA = {prop1: 42};
var objB = objA; 
objB.prop1 = 90;
console.log(objA) 
```
The output will `{prop1: 90}` because we're dealing with objects here. Objects are 
passed by reference, that is, `objA` and `objB` point to the same object in memory. 

#### Q. What would be the output of following code?

```javascript
var objA = {prop1: 42};
var objB = objA;
objB = {};
console.log(objA)
```

The output will `{prop1: 42}`. 

When we assign `objA` to `objB`, the `objB` variable will point
to the same object as the `objB` variable.

However, when we reassign `objB` to an empty object, we simply change where `objB` variable references to.
This doesn't affect where `objA` variable references to. 

#### Q. What would be the output of following code?

```javascript
var arrA = [0,1,2,3,4,5];
var arrB = arrA;
arrB[0]=42;
console.log(arrA)
```

The output will be `[42,1,2,3,4,5]`. 

Arrays are object in JavaScript and they are passed and assigned by reference. This is why
both `arrA` and `arrB` point to the same array `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`. That's why changing the first
element of the `arrB` will also modify `arrA`: it's the same array in the memory.

#### Q. What would be the output of following code?
```javascript
var arrA = [0,1,2,3,4,5];
var arrB = arrA.slice();
arrB[0]=42;
console.log(arrA)
```

The output will be `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`. 

The `slice` function copies all the elements of the array returning the new array. That's why
`arrA` and `arrB` reference two completely different arrays. 

#### Q. What would be the output of following code?

```javascript
var arrA = [{prop1: "value of array A!!"},  {someProp: "also value of array A!"}, 3,4,5];
var arrB = arrA;
arrB[0].prop1=42;
console.log(arrA);
```
The output will be `[{prop1: 42},  {someProp: "also value of array A!"}, 3,4,5]`. 

Arrays are object in JS, so both varaibles arrA and arrB point to the same array. Changing
`arrB[0]` is the same as changing `arrA[0]`


#### Q. What would be the output of following code?

```javascript
var arrA = [{prop1: "value of array A!!"}, {someProp: "also value of array A!"},3,4,5];
var arrB = arrA.slice();
arrB[0].prop1=42;
arrB[3] = 20;
console.log(arrA);
```

The output will be `[{prop1: 42},  {someProp: "also value of array A!"}, 3,4,5]`. 

The `slice` function copies all the elements of the array returning the new array. However,
it doesn't do deep copying. Instead it does shallow copying. You can imagine slice implemented like this: 
 
 ```javascript
function slice(arr) {
    var result = [];
    for (i = 0; i< arr.length; i++) {
        result.push(arr[i]);
    }
    return result; 
}
```

Look at the line with `result.push(arr[i])`. If `arr[i]` happens to be a number or string, 
it will be passed by value, in other words, copied. If `arr[i]` is an object, it will be passed by reference. 

In case of our array `arr[0]` is an object `{prop1: "value of array A!!"}`. Only the reference
to this object will be copied. This effectively means that arrays arrA and arrB share first
two elements. 

This is why changing the property of `arrB[0]` in `arrB` will also change the `arrA[0]`.

#### Q. What is the value of `foo`?
```javascript
var foo = 10 + '20';
```

*Answer:* `'1020'`, because of type coercion from Number to String

#### Q. How would you make this work?
```javascript
add(2, 5); // 7
add(2)(5); // 7
```

*Answer:* A general solution for any number of parameters
```js
'use strict';

let sum = (arr) => arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
let addGenerator = (numArgs, prevArgs) => {
  return function () {
    let totalArgs = prevArgs.concat(Array.from(arguments));
    if (totalArgs.length === numArgs) {
      return sum(totalArgs);
    }
    return addGenerator(numArgs, totalArgs);
  };
};

let add = addGenerator(2, []);

add(2, 5); // 7
add(2)(5); // 7
add()(2, 5); // 7
add()(2)(5); // 7
add()()(2)(5); // 7
```

#### Q. What value is returned from the following statement?
```javascript
"i'm a lasagna hog".split("").reverse().join("");
```

*Answer:* It's actually a reverse method for a string - `'goh angasal a m\'i'`

#### Q. What is the value of `window.foo`?
```javascript
( window.foo || ( window.foo = "bar" ) );
```

*Answer:* Always `'bar'`

#### Q. What is the outcome of the two alerts below?
```javascript
var foo = "Hello";
(function() {
  var bar = " World";
  alert(foo + bar);
})();
alert(foo + bar);
```

*Answer:*
- First: `Hello World`
- Second: Throws an exception, `ReferenceError: bar is not defined`

#### Q. What is the value of `foo.length`?
```javascript
var foo = [];
foo.push(1);
foo.push(2);
```

*Answer:* `.push` is mutable - `2`

#### Q. What is the value of `foo.x`?
```javascript
var foo = {n: 1};
var bar = foo;
foo.x = foo = {n: 2};
```

*Answer:* `undefined`. Rather, `bar.x` is `{n: 2}`.

`foo.x = foo = {n: 2}` is the same as `foo.x = (foo = {n: 2})`. It is because
a left term is first referenced and then a right term is evaluated when an
assignment is performed in JavaScript. When `foo.x` is referenced, it refers
to an original object, `{n: 1}`. So, when the result of the right term, `{n:
2}`, is evaluated, it will assigned to the original object, which is at the
moment referenced by `bar`.

#### Q. What does the following code print?*
```javascript
console.log('one');
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('two');
}, 0);
console.log('three');
```

*Answer:* `one`, `three` and `two`. It's because `console.log('two');` will be
invoked in the next event loop.

#### Q. Explain event delegation

Event delegation is a technique involving adding event listeners to a parent element instead of adding them to the descendant elements. The listener will fire whenever the event is triggered on the descendant elements due to event bubbling up the DOM. The benefits of this technique are:

* Memory footprint goes down because only one single handler is needed on the parent element, rather than having to attach event handlers on each descendant.
* There is no need to unbind the handler from elements that are removed and to bind the event for new elements.


#### Q. Explain how `this` works in JavaScript

There's no simple explanation for `this`; it is one of the most confusing concepts in JavaScript. A hand-wavey explanation is that the value of `this` depends on how the function is called. I have read many explanations on `this` online, and I found [Arnav Aggrawal](https://medium.com/@arnav_aggarwal)'s explanation to be the clearest. The following rules are applied:

1. If the `new` keyword is used when calling the function, `this` inside the function is a brand new object.
2. If `apply`, `call`, or `bind` are used to call/create a function, `this` inside the function is the object that is passed in as the argument.
3. If a function is called as a method, such as `obj.method()` — `this` is the object that the function is a property of.
4. If a function is invoked as a free function invocation, meaning it was invoked without any of the conditions present above, `this` is the global object. In a browser, it is the `window` object. If in strict mode (`'use strict'`), `this` will be `undefined` instead of the global object.
5. If multiple of the above rules apply, the rule that is higher wins and will set the `this` value.
6. If the function is an ES2015 arrow function, it ignores all the rules above and receives the `this` value of its surrounding scope at the time it is created.

For an in-depth explanation, do check out his [article on Medium](https://codeburst.io/the-simple-rules-to-this-in-javascript-35d97f31bde3).

#### Q. Can you give an example of one of the ways that working with this has changed in ES6?

ES6 allows you to use [arrow functions](http://2ality.com/2017/12/alternate-this.html#arrow-functions) which uses the [enclosing lexical scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#No_separate_this). This is usually convenient, but does prevent the caller from controlling context via `.call` or `.apply`—the consequences being that a library such as `jQuery` will not properly bind `this` in your event handler functions. Thus, it's important to keep this in mind when refactoring large legacy applications.


#### Q. Explain how prototypal inheritance works

This is an extremely common JavaScript interview question. All JavaScript objects have a `prototype` property, that is a reference to another object. When a property is accessed on an object and if the property is not found on that object, the JavaScript engine looks at the object's `prototype`, and the `prototype`'s `prototype` and so on, until it finds the property defined on one of the `prototype`s or until it reaches the end of the prototype chain. This behavior simulates classical inheritance, but it is really more of [delegation than inheritance](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects).

#### Q. Example of Prototypal Inheritance

We already have a build-in `Object.create`, but if you were to provide a polyfill for it, that might look like:

```javascript
if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') {
  Object.create = function (parent) {
    function Tmp() {}
    Tmp.prototype = parent;
    return new Tmp();
  };
}

const Parent = function() {
  this.name = "Parent";
}

Parent.prototype.greet = function() { console.log("hello from Parent"); }

const child = Object.create(Parent.prototype);

child.cry = function() {
  console.log("waaaaaahhhh!");
}

child.cry();
// Outputs: waaaaaahhhh!

child.greet();
// Outputs: hello from Parent
```

Things to note are:

* `.greet` is not defined on the _child_, so the engine goes up the prototype chain and finds `.greet` off the inherited from _Parent_.
* We need to call `Object.create` in one of following ways for the prototype methods to be inherited:
  * Object.create(Parent.prototype);
  * Object.create(new Parent(null));
  * Object.create(objLiteral);
  * Currently, `child.constructor` is pointing to the `Parent`:

```javascript
child.constructor
ƒ () {
  this.name = "Parent";
}
child.constructor.name
"Parent"
```
  * If we'd like to correct this, one option would be to do:

```javascript
function Child() {
  Parent.call(this);
  this.name = 'child';
}

Child.prototype = Parent.prototype;
Child.prototype.constructor = Child;

const c = new Child();

c.cry();
// Outputs: waaaaaahhhh!

c.greet();
// Outputs: hello from Parent

c.constructor.name;
// Outputs: "Child"
```


#### Q. What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?

Both are ways to implement a module system, which was not natively present in JavaScript until ES2015 came along. CommonJS is synchronous while AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) is obviously asynchronous. CommonJS is designed with server-side development in mind while AMD, with its support for asynchronous loading of modules, is more intended for browsers.

I find AMD syntax to be quite verbose and CommonJS is closer to the style you would write import statements in other languages. Most of the time, I find AMD unnecessary, because if you served all your JavaScript into one concatenated bundle file, you wouldn't benefit from the async loading properties. Also, CommonJS syntax is closer to Node style of writing modules and there is less context-switching overhead when switching between client side and server side JavaScript development.

I'm glad that with ES2015 modules, that has support for both synchronous and asynchronous loading, we can finally just stick to one approach. Although it hasn't been fully rolled out in browsers and in Node, we can always use transpilers to convert our code.


#### Q. Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: `function foo(){ }();`. What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?

IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions. The JavaScript parser reads `function foo(){ }();` as `function foo(){ }` and `();`, where the former is a *function declaration* and the latter (a pair of parentheses) is an attempt at calling a function but there is no name specified, hence it throws `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )`.

Here are two ways to fix it that involves adding more parentheses: `(function foo(){ })()` and `(function foo(){ }())`. Statements that begin with `function` are considered to be *function declarations*; by wrapping this function within `()`, it becomes a *function expression* which can then be executed with the subsequent `()`. These functions are not exposed in the global scope and you can even omit its name if you do not need to reference itself within the body.

You might also use `void` operator: `void function foo(){ }();`. Unfortunately, there is one issue with such approach. The evaluation of given expression is always `undefined`, so if your IIFE function returns anything, you can't use it. An example:

```
// Don't add JS syntax to this code block to prevent Prettier from formatting it.
const foo = void function bar() { return 'foo'; }();

console.log(foo); // undefined
```

#### Q. What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or undeclared? How would you go about checking for any of these states?

**Undeclared** variables are created when you assign a value to an identifier that is not previously created using `var`, `let` or `const`. Undeclared variables will be defined globally, outside of the current scope. In strict mode, a `ReferenceError` will be thrown when you try to assign to an undeclared variable. Undeclared variables are bad just like how global variables are bad. Avoid them at all cost! To check for them, wrap its usage in a `try`/`catch` block.

```js
function foo() {
  x = 1; // Throws a ReferenceError in strict mode
}

foo();
console.log(x); // 1
```

A variable that is `undefined` is a variable that has been declared, but not assigned a value. It is of type `undefined`. If a function does not return any value as the result of executing it is assigned to a variable, the variable also has the value of `undefined`. To check for it, compare using the strict equality (`===`) operator or `typeof` which will give the `'undefined'` string. Note that you should not be using the abstract equality operator to check, as it will also return `true` if the value is `null`.

```js
var foo;
console.log(foo); // undefined
console.log(foo === undefined); // true
console.log(typeof foo === 'undefined'); // true

console.log(foo == null); // true. Wrong, don't use this to check!

function bar() {}
var baz = bar();
console.log(baz); // undefined
```

A variable that is `null` will have been explicitly assigned to the `null` value. It represents no value and is different from `undefined` in the sense that it has been explicitly assigned. To check for `null,` simply compare using the strict equality operator. Note that like the above, you should not be using the abstract equality operator (`==`) to check, as it will also return `true` if the value is `undefined`.

```js
var foo = null;
console.log(foo === null); // true
console.log(typeof foo === 'object'); // true

console.log(foo == undefined); // true. Wrong, don't use this to check!
```

As a personal habit, I never leave my variables undeclared or unassigned. I will explicitly assign `null` to them after declaring if I don't intend to use it yet. If you use a linter in your workflow, it will usually also be able to check that you are not referencing undeclared variables.

#### Q. What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—scope chain even after the outer function has returned.

**Why would you use one?**

* Data privacy / emulating private methods with closures. Commonly used in the [module pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript).
* [Partial applications or currying](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/curry-or-partial-application-8150044c78b8#.l4b6l1i3x).


#### Q. Can you describe the main difference between a `.forEach` loop and a `.map()` loop and why you would pick one versus the other?

To understand the differences between the two, let's look at what each function does.

**`forEach`**

* Iterates through the elements in an array.
* Executes a callback for each element.
* Does not return a value.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = a.forEach((num, index) => {
  // Do something with num and/or index.
});

// doubled = undefined
```

**`map`**

* Iterates through the elements in an array.
* "Maps" each element to a new element by calling the function on each element, creating a new array as a result.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = a.map(num => {
  return num * 2;
});

// doubled = [2, 4, 6]
```

The main difference between `.forEach` and `.map()` is that `.map()` returns a new array. If you need the result, but do not wish to mutate the original array, `.map()` is the clear choice. If you simply need to iterate over an array, `forEach` is a fine choice.

#### Q. What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?

They can be used in IIFEs to encapsulate some code within a local scope so that variables declared in it do not leak to the global scope.

```js
(function() {
  // Some code here.
})();
```

As a callback that is used once and does not need to be used anywhere else. The code will seem more self-contained and readable when handlers are defined right inside the code calling them, rather than having to search elsewhere to find the function body.

```js
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}, 1000);
```

Arguments to functional programming constructs or Lodash (similar to callbacks).

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const double = arr.map(function(el) {
  return el * 2;
});
console.log(double); // [2, 4, 6]
```

#### Q. How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance?)

In the past, I've used Backbone for my models which encourages a more OOP approach, creating Backbone models and attaching methods to them.

The module pattern is still great, but these days, I use React/Redux which utilize a single-directional data flow based on Flux architecture. I would represent my app's models using plain objects and write utility pure functions to manipulate these objects. State is manipulated using actions and reducers like in any other Redux application.

I avoid using classical inheritance where possible. When and if I do, I stick to [these rules](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/how-to-use-classes-and-sleep-at-night-9af8de78ccb4).



#### Q. What's the difference between host objects and native objects?

Native objects are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification, such as `String`, `Math`, `RegExp`, `Object`, `Function`, etc.

Host objects are provided by the runtime environment (browser or Node), such as `window`, `XMLHTTPRequest`, etc.

#### Q. Difference between: `function Person(){}`, `var person = Person()`, and `var person = new Person()`?

This question is pretty vague. My best guess at its intention is that it is asking about constructors in JavaScript. Technically speaking, `function Person(){}` is just a normal function declaration. The convention is to use PascalCase for functions that are intended to be used as constructors.

`var person = Person()` invokes the `Person` as a function, and not as a constructor. Invoking as such is a common mistake if the function is intended to be used as a constructor. Typically, the constructor does not return anything, hence invoking the constructor like a normal function will return `undefined` and that gets assigned to the variable intended as the instance.

`var person = new Person()` creates an instance of the `Person` object using the `new` operator, which inherits from `Person.prototype`. An alternative would be to use `Object.create`, such as: `Object.create(Person.prototype)`.

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

var person = Person('John');
console.log(person); // undefined
console.log(person.name); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined

var person = new Person('John');
console.log(person); // Person { name: "John" }
console.log(person.name); // "john"
```

#### Q. What's the difference between `.call` and `.apply`?

Both `.call` and `.apply` are used to invoke functions and the first parameter will be used as the value of `this` within the function. However, `.call` takes in comma-separated arguments as the next arguments while `.apply` takes in an array of arguments as the next argument. An easy way to remember this is C for `call` and comma-separated and A for `apply` and an array of arguments.

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add.call(null, 1, 2)); // 3
console.log(add.apply(null, [1, 2])); // 3
```



#### Q. Explain `Function.prototype.bind`.

Taken word-for-word from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind):

> The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

In my experience, it is most useful for binding the value of `this` in methods of classes that you want to pass into other functions. This is frequently done in React components.

#### Q. When would you use `document.write()`?

`document.write()` writes a string of text to a document stream opened by `document.open()`. When `document.write()` is executed after the page has loaded, it will call `document.open` which clears the whole document (`<head>` and `<body>` removed!) and replaces the contents with the given parameter value. Hence it is usually considered dangerous and prone to misuse.

There are some answers online that explain `document.write()` is being used in analytics code or [when you want to include styles that should only work if JavaScript is enabled](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/06/three_javascrip_1.html). It is even being used in HTML5 boilerplate to [load scripts in parallel and preserve execution order](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/wiki/Script-Loading-Techniques#documentwrite-script-tag)! However, I suspect those reasons might be outdated and in the modern day, they can be achieved without using `document.write()`. Please do correct me if I'm wrong about this.


#### Q. What's the difference between feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string?

**Feature Detection**

Feature detection involves working out whether a browser supports a certain block of code, and running different code depending on whether it does (or doesn't), so that the browser can always provide a working experience rather crashing/erroring in some browsers. For example:

```js
if ('geolocation' in navigator) {
  // Can use navigator.geolocation
} else {
  // Handle lack of feature
}
```

[Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) is a great library to handle feature detection.

**Feature Inference**

Feature inference checks for a feature just like feature detection, but uses another function because it assumes it will also exist, e.g.:

```js
if (document.getElementsByTagName) {
  element = document.getElementById(id);
}
```

This is not really recommended. Feature detection is more foolproof.

**UA String**

This is a browser-reported string that allows the network protocol peers to identify the application type, operating system, software vendor or software version of the requesting software user agent. It can be accessed via `navigator.userAgent`. However, the string is tricky to parse and can be spoofed. For example, Chrome reports both as Chrome and Safari. So to detect Safari you have to check for the Safari string and the absence of the Chrome string. Avoid this method.


#### Q. Explain Ajax in as much detail as possible.

Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute use JSON instead of XML, due to the advantages of JSON being native to JavaScript.

The `XMLHttpRequest` API is frequently used for the asynchronous communication or these days, the `fetch` API.


#### Q. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Ajax?

**Advantages**

* Better interactivity. New content from the server can be changed dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.
* Reduce connections to the server since scripts and stylesheets only have to be requested once.
* State can be maintained on a page. JavaScript variables and DOM state will persist because the main container page was not reloaded.
* Basically most of the advantages of an SPA.

**Disadvantages**

* Dynamic webpages are harder to bookmark.
* Does not work if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.
* Some webcrawlers do not execute JavaScript and would not see content that has been loaded by JavaScript.
* Basically most of the disadvantages of an SPA.



#### Q. Explain how JSONP works (and how it's not really Ajax).

JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a method commonly used to bypass the cross-domain policies in web browsers because Ajax requests from the current page to a cross-origin domain is not allowed.

JSONP works by making a request to a cross-origin domain via a `<script>` tag and usually with a `callback` query parameter, for example: `https://example.com?callback=printData`. The server will then wrap the data within a function called `printData` and return it to the client.

```html
<!-- https://mydomain.com -->
<script>
function printData(data) {
  console.log(`My name is ${data.name}!`);
}
</script>

<script src="https://example.com?callback=printData"></script>
```

```js
// File loaded from https://example.com?callback=printData
printData({ name: 'Yang Shun' });
```

The client has to have the `printData` function in its global scope and the function will be executed by the client when the response from the cross-origin domain is received.

JSONP can be unsafe and has some security implications. As JSONP is really JavaScript, it can do everything else JavaScript can do, so you need to trust the provider of the JSONP data.

These days, [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) is the recommended approach and JSONP is seen as a hack.


#### Q. Have you ever used JavaScript templating? If so, what libraries have you used?

Yes. Handlebars, Underscore, Lodash, AngularJS, and JSX. I disliked templating in AngularJS because it made heavy use of strings in the directives and typos would go uncaught. JSX is my new favorite as it is closer to JavaScript and there is barely any syntax to learn. Nowadays, you can even use ES2015 template string literals as a quick way for creating templates without relying on third-party code.

```js
const template = `<div>My name is: ${name}</div>`;
```

However, do be aware of a potential XSS in the above approach as the contents are not escaped for you, unlike in templating libraries.



#### Q. Explain "hoisting".

Hoisting is a term used to explain the behavior of variable declarations in your code. Variables declared or initialized with the `var` keyword will have their declaration "moved" up to the top of the current scope, which we refer to as hoisting. However, only the declaration is hoisted, the assignment (if there is one), will stay where it is.

Note that the declaration is not actually moved - the JavaScript engine parses the declarations during compilation and becomes aware of declarations and their scopes. It is just easier to understand this behavior by visualizing the declarations as being hoisted to the top of their scope. Let's explain with a few examples.

```js
// var declarations are hoisted.
console.log(foo); // undefined
var foo = 1;
console.log(foo); // 1

// let/const declarations are NOT hoisted.
console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: bar is not defined
let bar = 2;
console.log(bar); // 2
```

Function declarations have the body hoisted while the function expressions (written in the form of variable declarations) only has the variable declaration hoisted.

```js
// Function Declaration
console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]
foo(); // 'FOOOOO'
function foo() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
}
console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]

// Function Expression
console.log(bar); // undefined
bar(); // Uncaught TypeError: bar is not a function
var bar = function() {
  console.log('BARRRR');
};
console.log(bar); // [Function: bar]
```



#### Q. Describe event bubbling.

When an event triggers on a DOM element, it will attempt to handle the event if there is a listener attached, then the event is bubbled up to its parent and the same thing happens. This bubbling occurs up the element's ancestors all the way to the `document`. Event bubbling is the mechanism behind event delegation.



#### Q. What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property"?

Attributes are defined on the HTML markup but properties are defined on the DOM. To illustrate the difference, imagine we have this text field in our HTML: `<input type="text" value="Hello">`.

```js
const input = document.querySelector('input');
console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello
```

But after you change the value of the text field by adding "World!" to it, this becomes:

```js
console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello World!
```


#### Q. Why is extending built-in JavaScript objects not a good idea?

Extending a built-in/native JavaScript object means adding properties/functions to its `prototype`. While this may seem like a good idea at first, it is dangerous in practice. Imagine your code uses a few libraries that both extend the `Array.prototype` by adding the same `contains` method, the implementations will overwrite each other and your code will break if the behavior of these two methods is not the same.

The only time you may want to extend a native object is when you want to create a polyfill, essentially providing your own implementation for a method that is part of the JavaScript specification but might not exist in the user's browser due to it being an older browser.

#### Q. Difference between document `load` event and document `DOMContentLoaded` event?

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

`window`'s `load` event is only fired after the DOM and all dependent resources and assets have loaded.


#### Q. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?

`==` is the abstract equality operator while `===` is the strict equality operator. The `==` operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions. The `===` operator will not do type conversion, so if two values are not the same type `===` will simply return `false`. When using `==`, funky things can happen, such as:

```js
1 == '1'; // true
1 == [1]; // true
1 == true; // true
0 == ''; // true
0 == '0'; // true
0 == false; // true
```

My advice is never to use the `==` operator, except for convenience when comparing against `null` or `undefined`, where `a == null` will return `true` if `a` is `null` or `undefined`.

```js
var a = null;
console.log(a == null); // true
console.log(a == undefined); // true
```

#### Q. Explain the same-origin policy with regards to JavaScript.

The same-origin policy prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. This policy prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through that page's Document Object Model.

#### Q. Make this work:

```js
duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
```

```js
function duplicate(arr) {
  return arr.concat(arr);
}

duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
```



#### Q. Why is it called a Ternary expression, what does the word "Ternary" indicate?

"Ternary" indicates three, and a ternary expression accepts three operands, the test condition, the "then" expression and the "else" expression. Ternary expressions are not specific to JavaScript and I'm not sure why it is even in this list.

#### Q. What is `"use strict";`? What are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?

'use strict' is a statement used to enable strict mode to entire scripts or individual functions. Strict mode is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript.

Advantages:

* Makes it impossible to accidentally create global variables.
* Makes assignments which would otherwise silently fail to throw an exception.
* Makes attempts to delete undeletable properties throw (where before the attempt would simply have no effect).
* Requires that function parameter names be unique.
* `this` is undefined in the global context.
* It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.
* It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.

Disadvantages:

* Many missing features that some developers might be used to.
* No more access to `function.caller` and `function.arguments`.
* Concatenation of scripts written in different strict modes might cause issues.

Overall, I think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, and I never had to rely on the features that strict mode blocks. I would recommend using strict mode.

#### Q. Create a for loop that iterates up to `100` while outputting **"fizz"** at multiples of `3`, **"buzz"** at multiples of `5` and **"fizzbuzz"** at multiples of `3` and `5`.

Check out this version of FizzBuzz by [Paul Irish](https://gist.github.com/jaysonrowe/1592432#gistcomment-790724).

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  let f = i % 3 == 0,
    b = i % 5 == 0;
  console.log(f ? (b ? 'FizzBuzz' : 'Fizz') : b ? 'Buzz' : i);
}
```

I would not advise you to write the above during interviews though. Just stick with the long but clear approach. For more wacky versions of FizzBuzz, check out the reference link below.


#### Q. Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch it?

Every script has access to the global scope, and if everyone uses the global namespace to define their variables, collisions will likely occur. Use the module pattern (IIFEs) to encapsulate your variables within a local namespace.



#### Q. Why would you use something like the `load` event? Does this event have disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives, and why would you use those?

The `load` event fires at the end of the document loading process. At this point, all of the objects in the document are in the DOM, and all the images, scripts, links and sub-frames have finished loading.

The DOM event `DOMContentLoaded` will fire after the DOM for the page has been constructed, but do not wait for other resources to finish loading. This is preferred in certain cases when you do not need the full page to be loaded before initializing.


#### Q. What is the extent of your experience with Promises and/or their polyfills?

Possess working knowledge of it. A promise is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future: either a resolved value or a reason that it's not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.

Some common polyfills are `$.deferred`, Q and Bluebird but not all of them comply with the specification. ES2015 supports Promises out of the box and polyfills are typically not needed these days.

#### Q. What are the pros and cons of using Promises instead of callbacks?

**Pros**

* Avoid callback hell which can be unreadable.
* Makes it easy to write sequential asynchronous code that is readable with `.then()`.
* Makes it easy to write parallel asynchronous code with `Promise.all()`.
* With promises, these scenarios which are present in callbacks-only coding, will not happen:
  * Call the callback too early
  * Call the callback too late (or never)
  * Call the callback too few or too many times
  * Fail to pass along any necessary environment/parameters
  * Swallow any errors/exceptions that may happen

**Cons**

* Slightly more complex code (debatable).
* In older browsers where ES2015 is not supported, you need to load a polyfill in order to use it.


#### Q. What tools and techniques do you use for debugging JavaScript code?

* React and Redux
  * [React Devtools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools)
  * [Redux Devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools)
* Vue
  * [Vue Devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools)
* JavaScript
  * [Chrome Devtools](https://hackernoon.com/twelve-fancy-chrome-devtools-tips-dc1e39d10d9d)
  * `debugger` statement
  * Good old `console.log` debugging


#### Q. What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?

For objects:

* `for-in` loops - `for (var property in obj) { console.log(property); }`. However, this will also iterate through its inherited properties, and you will add an `obj.hasOwnProperty(property)` check before using it.
* `Object.keys()` - `Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.keys()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.
* `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` - `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable and non-enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.

For arrays:

* `for` loops - `for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`. The common pitfall here is that `var` is in the function scope and not the block scope and most of the time you would want block scoped iterator variable. ES2015 introduces `let` which has block scope and it is recommended to use that instead. So this becomes: `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`.
* `forEach` - `arr.forEach(function (el, index) { ... })`. This construct can be more convenient at times because you do not have to use the `index` if all you need is the array elements. There are also the `every` and `some` methods which will allow you to terminate the iteration early.
* `for-of` loops - `for (let elem of arr) { ... }`. ES6 introduces a new loop, the `for-of` loop, that allows you to loop over objects that conform to the [iterable protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol) such as `String`, `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, etc. It combines the advantages of the `for` loop and the `forEach()` method. The advantage of the `for` loop is that you can break from it, and the advantage of `forEach()` is that it is more concise than the `for` loop because you don't need a counter variable. With the `for-of` loop, you get both the ability to break from a loop and a more concise syntax.

Most of the time, I would prefer the `.forEach` method, but it really depends on what you are trying to do. Before ES6, we used `for` loops when we needed to prematurely terminate the loop using `break`. But now with ES6, we can do that with `for-of` loops. I would use `for` loops when I need even more flexibility, such as incrementing the iterator more than once per loop.

Also, when using the `for-of` loop, if you need to access both the index and value of each array element, you can do so with the ES6 Array `entries()` method and destructuring:

```
const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (let [index, elem] of arr.entries()) {
  console.log(index, ': ', elem);
}
```

#### Q. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects.

Immutability is a core principle in functional programming, and has lots to offer to object-oriented programs as well. A mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

#### Q. What is an example of an immutable object in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, some built-in types (numbers, strings) are immutable, but custom objects are generally mutable.

Some built-in immutable JavaScript objects are `Math`, `Date`.

Here are a few ways to add/simulate immutability on plain JavaScript objects.

**Object Constant Properties**

By combining `writable: false` and `configurable: false`, you can essentially create a constant (cannot be changed, redefined or deleted) as an object property, like:

```js
let myObject = {};
Object.defineProperty(myObject, 'number', {
  value: 42,
  writable: false,
  configurable: false,
});
console.log(myObject.number); // 42
myObject.number = 43;
console.log(myObject.number); // 42
```

**Prevent Extensions**

If you want to prevent an object from having new properties added to it, but otherwise leave the rest of the object's properties alone, call `Object.preventExtensions(...)`:

```
var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

Object.preventExtensions(myObject);

myObject.b = 3;
myObject.b; // undefined
```

In non-strict mode, the creation of `b` fails silently. In strict mode, it throws a `TypeError`.

**Seal**

`Object.seal()` creates a "sealed" object, which means it takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.preventExtensions()` on it, but also marks all its existing properties as `configurable: false`.

So, not only can you not add any more properties, but you also cannot reconfigure or delete any existing properties (though you can still modify their values).

**Freeze**

`Object.freeze()` creates a frozen object, which means it takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.seal()` on it, but it also marks all "data accessor" properties as writable:false, so that their values cannot be changed.

This approach is the highest level of immutability that you can attain for an object itself, as it prevents any changes to the object or to any of its direct properties (though, as mentioned above, the contents of any referenced other objects are unaffected).

```js
var immutable = Object.freeze({});
```

Freezing an object does not allow new properties to be added to an object and prevents from removing or altering the existing properties. `Object.freeze()` preserves the enumerability, configurability, writability and the prototype of the object. It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.


#### Q. How can you achieve immutability in your own code?

One way to achieve immutability is to use libraries like [immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), [mori](https://github.com/swannodette/mori) or [immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer).

The alternative is to use `const` declarations combined with the techniques mentioned above for creation. For "mutating" objects, use the spread operator, `Object.assign`, `Array.concat()`, etc., to create new objects instead of mutate the original object.

Examples:

```js
// Array Example
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...arr, 4]; // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Object Example
const human = Object.freeze({race: 'human'});
const john = { ...human, name: 'John' }; // {race: "human", name: "John"}
const alienJohn = { ...john, race: 'alien' }; // {race: "alien", name: "John"}

#### Q. Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions.

Synchronous functions are blocking while asynchronous functions are not. In synchronous functions, statements complete before the next statement is run. In this case, the program is evaluated exactly in order of the statements and execution of the program is paused if one of the statements take a very long time.

Asynchronous functions usually accept a callback as a parameter and execution continue on the next line immediately after the asynchronous function is invoked. The callback is only invoked when the asynchronous operation is complete and the call stack is empty. Heavy duty operations such as loading data from a web server or querying a database should be done asynchronously so that the main thread can continue executing other operations instead of blocking until that long operation to complete (in the case of browsers, the UI will freeze).



#### Q. What is event loop? What is the difference between call stack and task queue?

The event loop is a single-threaded loop that monitors the call stack and checks if there is any work to be done in the task queue. If the call stack is empty and there are callback functions in the task queue, a function is dequeued and pushed onto the call stack to be executed.

If you haven't already checked out Philip Robert's [talk on the Event Loop](https://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/philip-roberts-what-the-heck-is-the-event-loop-anyway.html), you should. It is one of the most viewed videos on JavaScript.


#### Q. Explain the differences on the usage of `foo` between `function foo() {}` and `var foo = function() {}`

The former is a function declaration while the latter is a function expression. The key difference is that function declarations have its body hoisted but the bodies of function expressions are not (they have the same hoisting behavior as variables). For more explanation on hoisting, refer to the question above [on hoisting](#explain-hoisting). If you try to invoke a function expression before it is defined, you will get an `Uncaught TypeError: XXX is not a function` error.

**Function Declaration**

```js
foo(); // 'FOOOOO'
function foo() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
}
```

**Function Expression**

```js
foo(); // Uncaught TypeError: foo is not a function
var foo = function() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
};
```

#### Q. What are the differences between variables created using `let`, `var` or `const`?

Variables declared using the `var` keyword are scoped to the function in which they are created, or if created outside of any function, to the global object. `let` and `const` are _block scoped_, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest set of curly braces (function, if-else block, or for-loop).

```js
function foo() {
  // All variables are accessible within functions.
  var bar = 'bar';
  let baz = 'baz';
  const qux = 'qux';

  console.log(bar); // bar
  console.log(baz); // baz
  console.log(qux); // qux
}

console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: bar is not defined
console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: baz is not defined
console.log(qux); // ReferenceError: qux is not defined
```

```js
if (true) {
  var bar = 'bar';
  let baz = 'baz';
  const qux = 'qux';
}

// var declared variables are accessible anywhere in the function scope.
console.log(bar); // bar
// let and const defined variables are not accessible outside of the block they were defined in.
console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: baz is not defined
console.log(qux); // ReferenceError: qux is not defined
```

`var` allows variables to be hoisted, meaning they can be referenced in code before they are declared. `let` and `const` will not allow this, instead throwing an error.

```js
console.log(foo); // undefined

var foo = 'foo';

console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'baz' before initialization

let baz = 'baz';

console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'bar' before initialization

const bar = 'bar';
```

Redeclaring a variable with `var` will not throw an error, but 'let' and 'const' will.

```js
var foo = 'foo';
var foo = 'bar';
console.log(foo); // "bar"

let baz = 'baz';
let baz = 'qux'; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'baz' has already been declared
```

`let` and `const` differ in that `let` allows reassigning the variable's value while `const` does not.

```js
// This is fine.
let foo = 'foo';
foo = 'bar';

// This causes an exception.
const baz = 'baz';
baz = 'qux';
```

#### Q. What are the differences between ES6 class and ES5 function constructors?

Let's first look at example of each:

```js
// ES5 Function Constructor
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// ES6 Class
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

For simple constructors, they look pretty similar.

The main difference in the constructor comes when using inheritance. If we want to create a `Student` class that subclasses `Person` and add a `studentId` field, this is what we have to do in addition to the above.

```js
// ES5 Function Constructor
function Student(name, studentId) {
  // Call constructor of superclass to initialize superclass-derived members.
  Person.call(this, name);

  // Initialize subclass's own members.
  this.studentId = studentId;
}

Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

// ES6 Class
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, studentId) {
    super(name);
    this.studentId = studentId;
  }
}
```

It's much more verbose to use inheritance in ES5 and the ES6 version is easier to understand and remember.

#### Q. Can you offer a use case for the new arrow => function syntax? How does this new syntax differ from other functions?

One obvious benefit of arrow functions is to simplify the syntax needed to create functions, without a need for the `function` keyword. The `this` within arrow functions is also bound to the enclosing scope which is different compared to regular functions where the `this` is determined by the object calling it. Lexically-scoped `this` is useful when invoking callbacks especially in React components.



#### Q. What advantage is there for using the arrow syntax for a method in a constructor?

The main advantage of using an arrow function as a method inside a constructor is that the value of `this` gets set at the time of the function creation and can't change after that. So, when the constructor is used to create a new object, `this` will always refer to that object. For example, let's say we have a `Person` constructor that takes a first name as an argument has two methods to `console.log` that name, one as a regular function and one as an arrow function:

```js
const Person = function(firstName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.sayName1 = function() { console.log(this.firstName); };
  this.sayName2 = () => { console.log(this.firstName); };
};

const john = new Person('John');
const dave = new Person('Dave');

john.sayName1(); // John
john.sayName2(); // John

// The regular function can have its 'this' value changed, but the arrow function cannot
john.sayName1.call(dave); // Dave (because "this" is now the dave object)
john.sayName2.call(dave); // John

john.sayName1.apply(dave); // Dave (because 'this' is now the dave object)
john.sayName2.apply(dave); // John

john.sayName1.bind(dave)(); // Dave (because 'this' is now the dave object)
john.sayName2.bind(dave)(); // John

var sayNameFromWindow1 = john.sayName1;
sayNameFromWindow1(); // undefined (because 'this' is now the window object)

var sayNameFromWindow2 = john.sayName2;
sayNameFromWindow2(); // John
```

The main takeaway here is that `this` can be changed for a normal function, but the context always stays the same for an arrow function. So even if you are passing around your arrow function to different parts of your application, you wouldn't have to worry about the context changing.

This can be particularly helpful in React class components. If you define a class method for something such as a click handler using a normal function, and then you pass that click handler down into a child component as a prop, you will need to also bind `this` in the constructor of the parent component. If you instead use an arrow function, there is no need to also bind "this", as the method will automatically get its "this" value from its enclosing lexical context. (See this article for an excellent demonstration and sample code: https://medium.com/@machnicki/handle-events-in-react-with-arrow-functions-ede88184bbb)

#### Q. What is the definition of a higher-order function?

A higher-order function is any function that takes one or more functions as arguments, which it uses to operate on some data, and/or returns a function as a result. Higher-order functions are meant to abstract some operation that is performed repeatedly. The classic example of this is `map`, which takes an array and a function as arguments. `map` then uses this function to transform each item in the array, returning a new array with the transformed data. Other popular examples in JavaScript are `forEach`, `filter`, and `reduce`. A higher-order function doesn't just need to be manipulating arrays as there are many use cases for returning a function from another function. `Function.prototype.bind` is one such example in JavaScript.

**Map**

Let say we have an array of names which we need to transform each string to uppercase.

```js
const names = ['irish', 'daisy', 'anna'];
```

The imperative way will be as such:

```js
const transformNamesToUppercase = function(names) {
  const results = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    results.push(names[i].toUpperCase());
  }
  return results;
};
transformNamesToUppercase(names); // ['IRISH', 'DAISY', 'ANNA']
```

Use `.map(transformerFn)` makes the code shorter and more declarative.

```js
const transformNamesToUppercase = function(names) {
  return names.map(name => name.toUpperCase());
};
transformNamesToUppercase(names); // ['IRISH', 'DAISY', 'ANNA']
```

#### Q. Can you give an example for destructuring an object or an array?

Destructuring is an expression available in ES6 which enables a succinct and convenient way to extract values of Objects or Arrays and place them into distinct variables.

**Array destructuring**

```js
// Variable assignment.
const foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

const [one, two, three] = foo;
console.log(one); // "one"
console.log(two); // "two"
console.log(three); // "three"
```

```js
// Swapping variables
let a = 1;
let b = 3;

[a, b] = [b, a];
console.log(a); // 3
console.log(b); // 1
```

**Object destructuring**

```js
// Variable assignment.
const o = { p: 42, q: true };
const { p, q } = o;

console.log(p); // 42
console.log(q); // true
```

#### Q. ES6 Template Literals offer a lot of flexibility in generating strings, can you give an example?

Template literals help make it simple to do string interpolation, or to include variables in a string. Before ES2015, it was common to do something like this:

```js
var person = { name: 'Tyler', age: 28 };
console.log('Hi, my name is ' + person.name + ' and I am ' + person.age + ' years old!');
// 'Hi, my name is Tyler and I am 28 years old!'
```

With template literals, you can now create that same output like this instead:

```js
const person = { name: 'Tyler', age: 28 };
console.log(`Hi, my name is ${person.name} and I am ${person.age} years old!`);
// 'Hi, my name is Tyler and I am 28 years old!'
```

Note that you use backticks, not quotes, to indicate that you are using a template literal and that you can insert expressions inside the `${}` placeholders.

A second helpful use case is in creating multi-line strings. Before ES2015, you could create a multi-line string like this:

```js
console.log('This is line one.\nThis is line two.');
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

Or if you wanted to break it up into multiple lines in your code so you didn't have to scroll to the right in your text editor to read a long string, you could also write it like this:

```js
console.log('This is line one.\n' +
	'This is line two.');
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

Template literals, however, preserve whatever spacing you add to them. For example, to create that same multi-line output that we created above, you can simply do:

```js
console.log(`This is line one.
This is line two.`);
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

Another use case of template literals would be to use as a substitute for templating libraries for simple variable interpolations:

```js
const person = { name: 'Tyler', age: 28 };
document.body.innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <p>Name: ${person.name}</p>
    <p>Name: ${person.age}</p>
  </div>
`
```

**Note that your code may be susceptible to XSS by using `.innerHTML`. Sanitize your data before displaying it if it came from a user!**


#### Q. Can you give an example of a curry function and why this syntax offers an advantage?

Currying is a pattern where a function with more than one parameter is broken into multiple functions that, when called in series, will accumulate all of the required parameters one at a time. This technique can be useful for making code written in a functional style easier to read and compose. It's important to note that for a function to be curried, it needs to start out as one function, then broken out into a sequence of functions that each accepts one parameter.

```js
function curry(fn) {
  if (fn.length === 0) {
    return fn;
  }

  function _curried(depth, args) {
    return function(newArgument) {
      if (depth - 1 === 0) {
        return fn(...args, newArgument);
      }
      return _curried(depth - 1, [...args, newArgument]);
    };
  }

  return _curried(fn.length, []);
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

var curriedAdd = curry(add);
var addFive = curriedAdd(5);

var result = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(addFive); // [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```


#### Q. What are the benefits of using spread syntax and how is it different from rest syntax?

ES6's spread syntax is very useful when coding in a functional paradigm as we can easily create copies of arrays or objects without resorting to `Object.create`, `slice`, or a library function. This language feature is used often in Redux and rx.js projects.

```js
function putDookieInAnyArray(arr) {
  return [...arr, 'dookie'];
}

const result = putDookieInAnyArray(['I', 'really', "don't", 'like']); // ["I", "really", "don't", "like", "dookie"]

const person = {
  name: 'Todd',
  age: 29,
};

const copyOfTodd = { ...person };
```

ES6's rest syntax offers a shorthand for including an arbitrary number of arguments to be passed to a function. It is like an inverse of the spread syntax, taking data and stuffing it into an array rather than unpacking an array of data, and it works in function arguments, as well as in array and object destructuring assignments.

```js
function addFiveToABunchOfNumbers(...numbers) {
  return numbers.map(x => x + 5);
}

const result = addFiveToABunchOfNumbers(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10); // [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

const [a, b, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // a: 1, b: 2, rest: [3, 4]

const { e, f, ...others } = {
  e: 1,
  f: 2,
  g: 3,
  h: 4,
}; // e: 1, f: 2, others: { g: 3, h: 4 }
```

#### Q. How can you share code between files?

This depends on the JavaScript environment.

On the client (browser environment), as long as the variables/functions are declared in the global scope (`window`), all scripts can refer to them. Alternatively, adopt the Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) via RequireJS for a more modular approach.

On the server (Node.js), the common way has been to use CommonJS. Each file is treated as a module and it can export variables and functions by attaching them to the `module.exports` object.

ES2015 defines a module syntax which aims to replace both AMD and CommonJS. This will eventually be supported in both browser and Node environments.


#### Q. Why you might want to create static class members?

Static class members (properties/methods) are not tied to a specific instance of a class and have the same value regardless of which instance is referring to it. Static properties are typically configuration variables and static methods are usually pure utility functions which do not depend on the state of the instance.

#### Q. How do you clone an object in JavaScript?

Using the object spread operator ..., the object's own enumerable properties can be copied into the new object. This creates a shallow clone of the object.

```
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }
const shallowClone = { ...obj }

```
With this technique, prototypes are ignored. In addition, nested objects are not cloned, but rather their references get copied, so nested objects still refer to the same objects as the original. Deep-cloning is much more complex in order to effectively clone any type of object (Date, RegExp, Function, Set, etc) that may be nested within the object.

Other alternatives include:

1. **JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))** can be used to deep-clone a simple object, but it is CPU-intensive and only accepts valid JSON (therefore it strips functions and does not allow circular references).
1. **Object.assign({}, obj)** is another alternative.
1. **Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, key) => (acc[key] = obj[key], acc), {})** is another more verbose alternative that shows the concept in greater depth.
